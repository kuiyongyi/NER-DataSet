Around O 
1,000 O

" O 
these O

, O 
along O 
with O 
the O

According O

31 O

about O

back O 
to O

while O 
53 O

answered O 
that O 
they O 
did O

whether O 
the O

be O 
beneficial O 
or O 
harmful O 
for O

59 O

while O 
27 O

As O

, O 
the O

that O

only O 
spent O

no O

stream O 
of O

from O

ever O 
since O

According O 
to O

from O

at O

in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
at O 
any O

Perhaps O 
the O 
reason O 
for O 
the O 
apparent O 
lack O 
of O 
attachment O 
to O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
among O 
the O 
many O 
returned O 
Taiwan B-LOC

can O 
be O 
traced O 
to O 
historical O 
factors O 
. O 

In O 
1966 O 
, O 
Macau B-LOC 
was O 
convulsed O 
by O 
rioting O

several O

The O

left O 
- O 
wing O 
groups O 
, O 
which O 
were O 
closely O 
allied O 
with O

, O 
took O 
advantage O 
of O 
the O 
situation O 
to O 
get O 
KMT B-ORG 
organizations O 
in O

shut O 
down O

their O 
people O 
expelled O

Ever O 
since O 
, O 
Macau B-LOC 
has O 
been O 
regarded O 
in O 
certain O 
circles O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
as O 
a O 
" O 
semi-liberated O 
area O 
. O 
" O 

But O 
if O 
Macau B-LOC

pro-Beijing O 
forces O 
are O 
that O 
strong O 
, O 
how O 
come O 
so O 
many O

come O 
to O

to O 
get O

points O 
out O 
that O

This O 
presents O 
enormous O 
difficulties O 
for O 
the O 
localization O 
into O 
Chinese O 
of O 
Macau B-LOC 
's O 
mass O 
of O 
colonial O 
era O 
laws O 
. O 

Due O 
to O 
the O 
chronic O 
dearth O 
of O 
qualified O 
personnel O 
among O 
Macau B-LOC 
's O 
judiciary O 
, O 
much O 
of O 
the O 
work O 
of O 
legal O 
localization O 
depends O 
on O 
experts O 
from O 
the O 
mainland O 
. O 

But O 
according O 
to O 
Gary B-PER 
Mei I-PER 
, O 
" O 
The O 
socialist O 
law O 
that O 
they O 
are O 
used O 
to O

where O

are O 
closer O 
to O 
those O 
that O 
hold O 
in O

can O 
play O 
an O 
important O 
role O 
in O 
this O

process O

From O

" O 
If O

out O 
while O

, O 
if O 
it O 
ever O 
came O

none O

would O 
want O 
to O 
actively O 
" O 
align O 
" O 
themselves O 
with O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
, O 
given O 
the O 
pro-Beijing O 
political O 
climate O 
in O 
Macau B-LOC 
. O 

" O 
Which O 
is O 
closer O 
, O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
or O 
the O

? O 
" O 
asks O 
Tan B-PER 
. O 

On O 
the O 
other O 
hand O 
, O 
political O 
divisions O 
are O 
not O 
as O 
sharply O 
defined O 
in O 
Macau B-LOC 
as O 
they O 
are O 
in O 
Hong B-LOC 
Kong I-LOC 
, O 
and O 
people O 
are O 
not O 
so O 
uptight O 
about O 
who O 
they O 
come O 
into O 
contact O 
with O 
. O 

After O 
all O 
, O 
Macau B-LOC 
covers O 
an O 
area O 
of O 
just O 
23 O 
sq. O

roughly O 
equivalent O 
to O 
the B-LOC

and O 
has O 
a O

As O 
Leong B-PER 
Kam I-PER 
Chun I-PER 
says O 
, O 
Macau B-LOC 
" O 
still O 
has O 
the O 
feel O 
of O

rural O 
society O

" O 

You O 
bump O 
into O 
the O

all O 
the O

and O 
if O 
you O 
're O 
too O 
strict O 
about O

you O 
only O 
make O 
things O 
difficult O 
for O

" O 
Unlike O 
Hong B-LOC

people O 
, O 
Macau B-LOC 
people O 
do O 
n't O 
like O 
to O 
talk O 
politics O

" O 
says O 
Leong B-PER

Leong B-PER

belonging O 
to O 
the O 
pragmatic O 
" O

" O 
faction O 
. O 

Although O 
pro-Beijing O 
elements O 
prevail O 
in O 
Macau B-LOC 
, O 
the O 
former O 
Portuguese O 
administration O 
did O 
n't O 
seem O 
too O 
bothered O 
about O 
PRC B-ORG 
pressure O 
when O 
it O 
came O 
to O 
the O 
issue O 
of O 
ties O 
with O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
, O 
perhaps O 
because O 
their O 
only O 
concern O 
was O 
for O 
people O 
's O 
livelihood O 
. O 

Visa O 
- O 
free O 
entry O 
to O 
Macau B-LOC 
for O 
Taiwanese O 
is O 
a O 
case O 
in O 
point O 
. O 

Explains O 
Wong B-PER 
Hon I-PER 
Keong I-PER 
: O 
" O 
Macau B-LOC 
offers O 
visa O 
- O 
free O 
access O 
to O 
residents O 
of O

40 O

with O 
which O 
it O

without O 
there O 
being O

" O 

Moreover O 
, O 
Taiwanese O 
officials O 
have O 
always O 
had O 
an O 
easier O 
time O 
going O 
in O 
and O 
out O 
of O 
Macau B-LOC 
, O 
compared O 
with O 
the O 
fuss O 
involved O 
in O

even O

Taiwanese O

Taiwan I-ORG 
General I-ORG

of I-ORG 
Commerce I-ORG 
is O 
a O 
typical O 
example O 
. O 

Chen B-PER 
arrived O 
in O 
Macau B-LOC 
ten O 
years O 
ago O 
, O 
and O 
ran O 
air O 
- O 
tours O 
by O 
light O 
aircraft O 
until O 
the O

international O 
airport O 
opened O 
, O 
after O 
which O 
he O 
moved O 
into O 
the O 
liquor O 
trade O 
. O 

When O 
he O 
travels O 
to O 
the O 
mainland O 
he O 
takes O 
his O 
Macau B-LOC 
Resident O

Permit O 
, O 
but O 
when O 
he O 
comes O 
back O 
to O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
he O 
uses O 
his O 
ROC O 
passport O 
. O 

As O 
part O 
of O 
his O 
efforts O 
to O 
attract O 
more O 
Taiwanese O 
investors O 
to O 
do O 
business O 
in O 
Macau B-LOC 
, O 
he O 
helped O 
introduce O 
President O 
Group O 
CEO O 
Kao B-PER 
Chin I-PER 
- I-PER 
yen I-PER 
to O 
the O 
territory O 
, O 
and O 
in O 
order O 
to O 
build O 
better O

with O 
the O 
mainland O

in O 
Macau B-LOC 
to O 
install O 
satellite O

But O 
when O 
he O 
found O 
that O 
his O 
elementary O

school O

age O 
grandson O 
was O 
speaking O

all O

quickly O 
sent O

, O 
fearing O 
that O 
the O

losing O

tongue O 
. O 

A O 
consensus O 
among O 
the O 
Taiwanese O 
living O

working O 
in O 
Macau B-LOC 
is O 
that O 
" O

decide O 
what O

" O 

Another O 
point O 
they O 
agree O 
on O 
is O 
that O 
not O 
enough O 
was O 
done O 
in O 
the O 
past O 
to O 
develop O 
ties O 
between O

that O

the O

change O

out O

, O 
Macau B-LOC 
also O 
has O 
its O

Now O 
with O

, O 
the O 
intermingling O 
of O

is O 
nothing O

, O 
but O 
400 O

, O 
the O 
people O 
of O

Their O

can O 
be O 
seen O 
everywhere O 
in O 
the O

and O 
literature O 
of O

The O

Marreiros B-PER

, O 
points O 
out O 
that O 
while O 
the O

European O 
, O 
the O 
arrangement O 
of O

often O 
done O 
in O 
a O 
Chinese O

Marreiros B-PER

that O 
the O

its O

" O 
Macau B-LOC

Three O

" O

Four O

Now O 
that O

Forty O 
years O

just O

the O

of O

Although O

Twenty O

the O

dreadfully O

if O 
you O 
so O

If O

this O

to O 
the O 
magic O

the O 
unceasing O 
efforts O 
towards O

development O 
and O 
upgrading O 
put O 
in O 
by O 
the O

Everything O

But O 
around O 
1987 O 
, O 
under O 
strong O 
US B-LOC

, O 
the O 
NT O

appreciated O 
, O

lost O 
their O

Many O 
firms O 
moved O 
production O 
to O 
mainland O 
China B-LOC 
or O 
Southeast B-LOC 
Asia I-LOC 
, O 
and O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
remaining O

was O 
dramatically O 
reshuffled O

the O 
departure O 
of O 
the O

, O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
lost O 
its O 
" O

status O 
. O 

But O 
looking O 
from O 
another O 
perspective O 
, O 
the O 
Taiwanese O 
manufacturers O 
who O 
spread O 
all O 
over O 
Southeast B-LOC 
Asia I-LOC 
, O 
mainland O 
China B-LOC

Latin B-LOC 
America I-LOC 
were O 
still O 
very O 
much O 
a O 
force O 
to O 
be O 
reckoned O 
with O 
, O 
and O 
in O 
their O 
new O 
locations O 
they O 
continued O 
to O 
source O 
raw O 
materials O

semi-finished O 
goods O 
from O 
Taiwan B-LOC

With O 
their O 
support O 
, O 
the O

able O 
to O 
stay O

In O 
September O 
1998 O 
, O 
while O 
the O

up O 
over O 
40 O

the O

In O

after O

the O

" O 
As O

did O

But O 
after O 
going O

- O 
to O 
- O 
head O 
with O 
TCH B-ORG 
for O 
several O 
years O 
, O 
Dupont B-ORG 
realized O 
how O 
resilient O 
the O

was O 
, O 
and O 
since O 
then O 
the O 
two O

have O 
begun O 
to O 
cooperate O

Currently O 
, O 
TCH B-ORG 
is O 
the O

fifth O

, O 
supplying O 
8 O 
% O

For O 
this O 
reason O 
, O 
TCH B-ORG 
approached O 
the O 
CTI B-ORG 
to O 
conduct O 
a O 
series O 
of O 
cooperative O 
development O 
projects O 
. O 

Grace B-PER 
Kuo I-PER 
says O 
the O 
textile O 
industry O 
today O 
needs O 
to O 
take O 
a O 
lead O 
from O 
the O 
electronics O 
industry O 
, O 
and O 
constantly O 
strive O 
for O 
innovation O 
: O 
" O 
What O 
consumer O 
today O 
does O 
n't O 
already O 
have O 
a O

But O 
95 O 
% O

Taiwan B-LOC

Hence O 
in O

on O

When O

William B-PER

observes O 
that O 
when O 
most O

see O 
something O 
new O 
at O 
an O 
overseas O

they O 
will O 
bring O

With O

However O 
, O 
Shang B-PER

not O 
see O 
this O 
as O 
a O

For O 
example O 
, O 
he O 
read O

that O 
because O

The O

fully O 
clarified O

it O 
has O 
certainly O 
greatly O 
affected O 
James B-PER

public O 
support O 
. O 

Before O 
the O

was O 
getting O 
more O 
than O 
30 O

Here O

however O 
, O 
Huang B-PER 
has O 
written O 
about O 
a O 
different O 
sort O 
of O

one O 
who O 
carries O 
within O 
himself O 
a O 
traditional O

In O

the O 
" O

In O 
" O 
An O

, O 
" O 
the O 
reader O 
feels O 
very O 
strongly O 
that O 
Huang B-PER

is O 
playing O 
two O 
roles O 
: O 
that O 
of O

little O 
boy O 
listening O 
intently O 
to O

of O

wishes O 
to O 
give O

to O 
its O 
earthy O 
old O 
knowledge O

is O 
the O 
unforgettable O 
elderly O 
protagonist O 
of O

" O 
the O 
next O

does O

have O 
the O 
life O 
of O 
ease O 
of O 
the O 
" O

" O 
and O 
he O 
stubbornly O 
resists O 
the O 
encroachment O 
of O 
his O 
enemy O 
, O 
modern O 
life O 
. O 

In O 
this O 
tragic O 
story O 
, O 
Ah B-PER 
- I-PER 
sheng I-PER 
is O 
ultimately O 
steamrollered O 
by O 
the O 
massive O 
momentum O 
of O 
the O 
new O 
. O 

But O 
while O 
the O 
tragedy O 
plays O 
itself O 
out O 
, O 
Huang B-PER 
makes O 
it O 
clear O 
to O 
the O 
reader O 
that O 
he O 
stands O 
firmly O 
on O 
the O 
side O 
of O 
Ah B-PER 
- I-PER 
sheng I-PER 
in O 
this O 
conflict O 
. O 

Huang B-PER 
includes O 
several O 
comic O 
and O 
even O 
farcical O 
scenes O 
, O 
one O 
of O 
which O 
occurs O 
during O 
a O 
carnivalesque O 
town O 
meeting O 
. O 

There O 
, O 
Ah B-PER 
- I-PER 
sheng I-PER 
demonstrates O 
a O 
startling O 
ability O 
to O 
respond O 
to O 
circumstances O 
and O 
succeeds O 
in O 
wrecking O 
the O 
meeting O 
hall O 
as O 
he O 
makes O 
an O 
eloquent O 
speech O 
on O 
the O 
love O 
of O 
one O 
's O 
family O 
and O 
birthplace O 
, O 
making O 
" O 
the O 
entire O 
village O 
jump O 
to O 
its O 
feet O 
in O 
agitation O 
. O 
" O 

This O 
theme O 
of O 
tragedy O 
resulting O 
from O 
changing O 
times O 
has O 
appeared O 
in O 
Huang B-PER 
's O 
earlier O 
work O 
, O 
in O 
" O 
Cymbal O 
, O 
" O 
for O 
example O 
, O 
which O 
was O 
strongly O 
influenced O 
by O

The O 
Story O 
of O

Q O 
. O 

In O 
" O 
Cymbal O 
, O 
" O 
the O 
age O 
of O 
the O 
protagonist O 
, O 
Foolish B-PER 
Chin I-PER 
, O 
is O 
unclear O 
, O 
but O 
the O 
theme O 
of O 
obsolescence O 
remains O 
. O 

Chin B-PER 
's O 
work O 
- O 
making O 
announcements O 
in O 
the O 
street O 
while O 
using O 
a O 
cymbal O 
to O 
attract O 
attention O 
- O 
has O 
been O 
made O 
obsolete O 
by O 
the O 
spread O 
of O 
the O 
megaphone O 
, O 
undercutting O 
his O 
social O 
status O 
and O 
taking O 
away O 
his O 
livelihood O 
. O 

Chin B-PER 
thus O 
takes O 
on O 
the O 
role O 
of O 
a O 
member O 
of O 
the O 
older O 
generation O 
who O 
has O 
lost O 
his O 
struggle O 
to O 
make O 
the O 
transition O 
to O 
modern O 
reality O 
. O 

There O 
are O 
reasons O 
to O 
look O 
back O 
to O 
Huang B-PER 
's O 
early O 
work O 
. O 

In O 
the O 
extremely O 
nationalistic O 
atmosphere O 
of O 
the O 
1970s O 
, O 
Huang B-PER 
changed O 
his O 
focus O 
for O 
a O 
time O 
, O 
writing O 
about O 
the O 
hatred O 
of O 
Japan B-LOC 
-LRB- O 
Sayonara O 
, O 
Goodbye O 
-RRB- O 
and O 
about O 
anti-American O 
sentiments O 
-LRB- O 
I O 
Love O 
Mary O 
-RRB- O 
. O 

Second O 
, O 
in O 
them O 
Huang B-PER 
had O 
moved O 
away O 
from O 
his O 
greatest O 
strength O 
, O 
the O 
characters O 
and O 
settings O 
with O 
which O 
he O 
was O 
truly O 
familiar O 
. O 

As O 
a O 
result O 
, O 
Huang B-PER 
's O 
1970s O 
writings O 
were O 
simply O 
records O 
of O 
the O 
period O 
in O 
which O 
they O 
were O 
written O 
and O 
creative O 
experiments O 
. O 

The O 
second O 
reason O 
to O 
look O 
back O 
at O 
Huang B-PER 
's O 
early O 
fiction O 
is O 
to O 
highlight O 
the O 
continuity O 
of O 
Letting O 
Them O 
Go O 
. O 

Although O 
it O 
has O 
been O 
more O 
than O 
ten O 
years O 
since O 
Huang B-PER 
's O 
last O 
collection O 
of O 
fiction O 
, O 
and O 
in O 
spite O 
of O 
the O 
fact O 
that O 
37 O 
years O 
separate O 
" O 
Cheng O 
- O 
tsai O 
Gets O 
off O 
the O 
Bus O 
" O 
and O 
" O 
Ticket O 
Window O 
, O 
" O 
there O 
is O 
something O 
at O 
the O 
core O 
of O 
Huang B-PER 
's O 
fiction O 
which O 
has O 
not O 
changed O 
. O 

In O 
his O 
introduction O 
to O 
Letting O 
Them O 
Go O 
, O 
Huang B-PER 
mentions O 
his O 
deep O 
distress O 
at O 
the O 
plight O 
of O 
the O 
elderly O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
today O 
, O 
notes O 
that O 
he O 
himself O 
is O 
just O 
beginning O 
to O 
enter O 
his O 
twilight O 
years O 
, O 
and O 
compares O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
callous O 
treatment O 
of O 
the O 
elderly O 
to O 
the O 
way O 
in O 
which O 
the O 
elderly O 
were O 
left O 
to O 
live O 
or O 
die O 
on O 
their O 
own O 
in O 
the O 
mountains O 
in O 
You O 
Shan O 
Jie O 
Kao O 
. O 

All O 
of O 
this O 
could O 
very O 
easily O 
give O 
the O 
reader O 
the O 
mistaken O 
impression O 
that O 
Huang B-PER 
's O 
vision O 
of O 
the O 
elderly O 
is O 
a O 
new O 
development O 
. O 

In O 
Letting O 
Them O 
Go O 
, O 
what O 
we O 
are O 
actually O 
seeing O 
is O 
the O 
rebirth O 
of O 
Huang B-PER 
's O 
original O 
passion O 
. O 

Huang B-PER 
Chun I-PER 
- I-PER 
ming I-PER 
has O 
often O 
discussed O 
the O 
fact O 
that O 
he O 
was O 
raised O 
largely O 
by O 
his O 
grandparents O 
, O 
and O 
that O 
he O 
had O 
an O 
unusually O 
close O 
relationship O 
to O 
them O 
. O 

This O 
background O 
accounts O 
for O 
the O 
unique O 
" O 
generation O 
gap O 
" O 
approach O 
utilized O 
by O 
Huang B-PER 
in O 
his O 
fiction O 
. O 

Each O 
of O 
Huang B-PER 
's O 
works O 
describes O 
a O 
particular O 
person O 
or O 
thing O 
, O 
and O 
has O 
an O 
" O 
implied O 
reader O 
" O 
at O 
which O 
it O 
is O 
directed O 
. O 

In O 
the O 
past O 
, O 
Huang B-PER 
's O 
" O 
generation O 
gap O 
" O 
separated O 
him O 
from O 
the O 
people O 
he O 
was O 
writing O 
about O 
- O 
people O 
of O 
his O 
grandparents O 
' O 
generation O 
, O 
two O 
generations O 
removed O 
from O 
his O 
own O 
. O 

Another O 
aspect O 
of O 
Huang B-PER 
's O 
work O 
is O 
that O 
it O 
presents O 
many O 
of O 
the O 
characteristics O 
sociology O 
attributes O 
to O 
relationships O 
between O 
people O 
two O 
generations O 
removed O 
from O 
one O 
another O 
. O 

Viewing O 
Huang B-PER 
's O 
fiction O 
in O 
this O 
way O 
, O 
we O 
can O 
perhaps O 
more O 
clearly O 
see O 
wherein O 
lies O 
its O 
charm O 
. O 

Huang B-PER 
is O 
never O 
derisive O 
or O 
critical O 
of O 
his O 
elderly O 
characters O 
. O 

If O 
we O 
compare O 
him O 
to O 
other O 
Nativist O 
writers O 
who O 
address O 
the O 
tragedy O 
of O 
the O 
rural O 
elderly O 
unable O 
to O 
adapt O 
to O 
the O 
modern O 
industrial O 
world O 
, O 
we O 
note O 
that O 
Huang B-PER 
is O 
reluctant O 
to O 
expose O 
his O 
elderly O 
characters O 
to O 
unmitigated O 
suffering O 
. O 

Huang B-PER 
takes O 
a O 
much O 
gentler O 
approach O 
- O 
not O 
because O 
he O 
thinks O 
the O 
modern O 
world O 
a O 
perfect O 
place O 
, O 
but O 
because O 
he O 
can O 
not O 
bear O 
to O 
be O 
so O 
harsh O

Huang B-PER 
's O 
tender O 
- O 
heartedness O 
is O 
apparent O 
to O 
the O 
reader O 
of O 
his O 
work O 
. O 

In O 
his O 
fiction O 
, O 
Huang B-PER 
is O 
both O 
more O 
sensitive O 
to O 
and O 
places O 
greater O 
importance O 
on O 
the O 
elderly O 
's O 
haphazard O 
means O 
of O 
expressing O 
affection O 
than O 
are O 
other O 
Nativist O 
writers O 
. O 

In O 
this O 
later O 
story O 
, O 
the O 
elderly O 
Ah B-PER 
- I-PER 
wei I-PER 
inexplicably O 
goes O 
out O 
and O 
catches O 
an O 
egret O 
, O 
then O 
just O 
as O 
inexplicably O 
lets O 
it O 
go O 
. O 

Both O 
of O 
these O 
actions O 
are O 
indirect O 
expressions O 
of O 
a O 
deep O 
love O 
he O 
can O 
not O 
give O 
voice O 
to O 
yet O 
nonetheless O 
feels O 
for O 
his O 
son O

When O 
Huang B-PER 
writes O 
of O 
sad O 
events O 
, O 
his O 
readers O 
' O 
eyes O 
really O 
do O 
fill O 
with O 
tears O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
the O 
most O 
exceptional O 
thing O 
about O 
Huang B-PER 
as O 
a O 
writer O 
is O 
that O 
he O 
is O 
not O 
satisfied O 
with O 
making O 
his O 
readers O 
cry O

However O 
, O 
as O 
China B-LOC 
covers O 
such O 
a O 
vast O 
territory O 
, O 
this O 
pudding O 
comes O 
in O 
different O 
versions O 
according O 
to O 
region O 
. O 

For O 
example O 
, O 
people O 
in O 
the O 
belt O 
south O 
of O 
the B-LOC 
Yangtze I-LOC 
River I-LOC 
generally O 
eat O 
" O 
Ningpo B-LOC 
pudding O 
, O 
" O 
made O 
from O 
sticky O 
rice O 
shaped O 
into O 
broad O

, O 
while O 
those O 
hailing O 
from O 
Guangdong B-LOC 
and O 
the O 
Southern B-LOC 
Fujian I-LOC 
region O 
go O 
for O 
luobo O 
pudding O

made O 
from O 
a O

white O 
turnip O

As O 
Lin B-PER 
writes O 
: O 
" O 
Although O 
my O 
family O 
moved O 
around O 
a O 
lot O 
when O 
I O 
was O 
little O 
, O 
Mother O 
was O 
quite O 
stubborn O 
about O 
personally O 
taking O 
charge O 
in O 
the O 
kitchen O 
every O 
New O 
Year O 
to O 
make O 
luobo O 
pudding O 
for O 
the O 
whole O 
family O 
. O 

So O 
when O 
we O 
spent O 
New O 
Year O 
in O 
Shanghai B-LOC 
, O 
we O 
did O 
n't O 
have O 
Ningpo B-LOC 
pudding O 
like O 
the O 
rest O 
of O 
the O 
people O 
there O 
, O 
and O 
when O 
we O 
were O 
in O 
Tokyo B-LOC 
we O 
did O 
n't O 
have O 
the O 
" O 
mirror O 
cake O 
" O 
that O 
they O 
like O 
in O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

Lin B-PER 
recalls O 
that O 
there O 
were O 
so O 
many O 
mouths O 
to O 
feed O 
at O 
New O 
Year O 
that O 
they O 
had O 
to O 
use O 
two O 
or O 
three O 
large O 
bamboo O 
steamers O 
to O 
make O 
the O 
puddings O 
. O 

Lin B-PER 
's O 
mother O 
was O 
n't O 
too O 
happy O 
about O 
this O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
kitchen O 
helpers O 
would O 
impatiently O 
wave O 
the O 
kids O 
away O 
, O 
calling O 
: O 
" O 
Shoo O 
! O 
Shoo O 
! O 
Go O 
outside O 
and O 
play O 
! O 
" O 

However O 
, O 
as O 
Lin B-PER 
grew O 
up O 
, O 
her O 
mother O 
would O 
call O 
her O 
and O 
the O 
other O 
girls O 
to O 
her O 
side O 
to O 
watch O 
and O 
help O 
out O 
. O 

But O 
come O

, O 
Lin B-PER 
Wen I-PER

still O 
prepares O 
several O

old O

, O 
so O 
that O 
her O 
family O 
and O

can O 
enjoy O 
New O

pudding O 
" O 
the O

like O 
the O 
unusual O 
quiet O 
that O 
descends O 
on O 
Taipei B-LOC

streets O 
for O 
the O 
period O 
of O 
the O

, O 
and O 
since O 
we O 
did O 
n't O 
want O 
to O 
make O 
any O 
special O

, O 
we O 
just O 
stayed O

" O

" O 
is O 
a O 
way O

suits O

. O 
" O 

Yang B-PER 
's O 
strongest O 
association O 
with O 
New O

is O 
of O 
going O 
to O 
do O 
the O 
New O

shopping O 
with O

of O 
the O 
excitement O 
that O 
she O 
remembered O 
feeling O 
, O 
as O 
a O 
child O 
, O 
about O 
getting O 
to O 
wear O 
new O

new O

, O 
Yang B-PER 
later O 
began O 
to O 
question O 
this O 
way O 
of O 
spending O 
New O 
Year O 
. O 

" O 
It O 
was O 
only O 
after O 
I O 
had O 
kids O 
of O 
my O 
own O 
that O 
I O 
began O 
to O 
rethink O 
the O 
importance O 
of O 
New O 
Year O 
- O 
partly O 
out O 
of O 
nostalgia O 
, O 
and O 
partly O 
to O 
pass O 
the O 
tradition O 
on O 
to O 
my O 
children O 
, O 
" O

Yang B-PER

" O 
continues O 
Yang B-PER 
, O 
" O 
the O 
end O 
of O 
the O

can O 
also O 
serve O 
as O 
a O 
reminder O 
for O

review O 
their O

with O 
all O

taken O

Yang B-PER 
settles O 
down O

quietly O 
reflect O 
on O 
how O 
she O 
has O 
grown O 
during O 
the O 
past O 
twelve O

to O 
draw O 
up O 
her O 
personal O 
" O

for O 
the O

Yang B-PER 
feels O 
that O 
if O 
we O 
redefine O 
New O 
Year O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
its O 
contemplative O 
and O 
spiritual O 
meaning O 
, O 
rather O 
than O 
just O 
regarding O 
it O 
as O 
an O 
occasion O 
for O 
feasting O 
and O 
partying O 
, O 
then O 
we O 
can O 
better O 
sense O 
how O 
time O 
passes O

see O 
that O 
another O 
phase O

" O

ask O 
of O

" O 

Hsu B-PER 
points O 
out O 
that O 
Teng B-PER 
's O 
study O 
of O 
the O 
Thao O 
is O 
especially O 
valuable O 
because O 
no O 
one O 
else O 
has O 
done O 
any O 
fieldwork O 
on O 
this O 
tribe O 
since O 
1958 O 
. O 

Teng B-PER 
spent O 
six O 
years O 
recording O

, O

. O 

According O 
to O 
Hsu B-PER 
, O 
the O 
theoretical O 
framework O 
used O 
by O

must O 
be O 
supported O 
by O 
the O 
results O 
of O 
fieldwork O 
, O 
and O 
Teng B-PER 
has O 
done O 
a O 
very O 
thorough O 
job O 
of O 
providing O 
excellent O 
first O 
- O 
hand O 
materials O 
. O 

Teng B-PER 
is O 
in O 
a O 
better O 
position O 
than O 
a O 
professional O 
researcher O 
to O 
engage O 
in O

of O 
the O 
Thao O 
, O 
for O 
example O 
, O 
because O 
he O 
lives O 
in O 
the O

Hsu B-PER 
Mu I-PER

is O 
now O 
writing O 
a O 
book O 
on O 
the O 
history O 
of O

, O 
and O 
is O 
relying O 
heavily O 
on O 
Teng B-PER 
's O 
work O 
. O 

In O 
Hsu B-PER 
's O 
opinion O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
Teng B-PER 
's O 
deep O 
concern O 
for O 
his O 
fellow O 
human O 
beings O 
that O 
has O 
enabled O 
him O 
to O 
devote O 
so O 
much O 
of O 
himself O 
for O 
such O 
a O 
long O 
time O 
to O 
his O 
fieldwork O 
. O 

" O 
It O 
is O

" O 
says O 
Hsu B-PER 
, O 
" O 
who O 
shows O 
this O 
quality O 
. O 
" O 

This O 
concern O 
for O 
his O 
fellow O 
human O 
beings O 
has O 
earned O 
Teng B-PER 
many O 
friends O 
among O 
the O 
aborigines O 
. O 

One O 
such O 
friend O 
is O 
a O

the O 
great O

of O

Says O 
Takken B-PER 
, O 
" O 
I O 
had O 
never O 
even O 
heard O 
of O 
the O 
Wushe O

when O 
I O 
was O 
a O 
kid O 
. O 

Says O 
the O 
teacher O 
Tajis B-PER 
Bawan I-PER 
, O 
" O 
Before O 
I O 
met O

I O 
did O 
n't O

a O 
very O 
clear O 
image O 
of O 
who O 
we O 
were O 
as O 
a O 
people O 
, O 
and O 
I O 
had O 
only O 
heard O 
unsubstantiated O 
rumors O 
and O 
snippets O 
about O 
the O 
Wushe O 
Incident O 
. O 
" O 

Later O 
, O 
however O 
, O 
he O 
was O 
invited O 
to O 
accompany O 
Teng B-PER 
on O 
his O 
trips O 
to O 
interview O 
old O 
folks O 
in O 
the O 
mountains O 
. O 

These O 
forays O 
were O 
very O 
moving O 
experiences O 
for O 
Bawan B-PER 
. O 

With O 
Teng B-PER 
's O 
encouragement O 
, O 
Bawan B-PER 
started O 
interviewing O 
old O 
folks O 
on O 
his O 
own O

recording O 
his O

other O

. O 

At O 
the O 
same O 
time O 
, O 
there O 
are O 
some O 
Atayal O 
people O 
who O 
view O 
Teng B-PER 
with O 
suspicion O 
, O 
saying O 
, O 
" O 
He O 
's O 
just O 
another O 
plains O 
dweller O 
trying O 
to O 
make O 
money O 
. O 
" O 

Bawan B-PER 
, O 
too O 
, O 
had O 
once O 
harbored O 
such O 
suspicions O 
, O 
but O 
since O 
getting O 
involved O 
in O 
fieldwork O 
himself O 
, O 
he O 
has O 
discovered O 
how O 
quickly O 
the O 
expenses O 
add O 
up O 
for O 
transportation O 
, O 
development O 
of O 
slides O 
, O 
and O 
so O 
much O 
more O 
. O 

As O 
for O 
fame O 
, O 
Bawan B-PER 
asks O 
, O 
" O 
So O 
what O 
if O 
he O 
has O 
become O 
famous O 
? O 

To O 
thank O 
him O 
for O 
his O 
contributions O 
to O 
their O

Teng B-PER

" O 
which O 
means O

in O

Bawan B-PER 
simply O 
considers O 
him O 
a O 
member O 
of O 
the O 
Atayal O

The O 
Thao O

the O 
story O 
of O 
Inoue B-PER 
Hajime I-PER 
, O 
a O 
Japanese O 
doctor O 
whose O 
life O 
Teng B-PER 
has O 
been O 
studying O 
for O 
the O 
past O 
ten O 
years O 
. O 

Says O 
Teng B-PER 
, O 
" O 
After O 
Inoue B-PER 
's O 
father O 
met O 
his O 
death O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
at O 
the O 
hands O 
of O 
aborigines O 
on O 
a O 
head O 
hunting O 
expedition O 
, O 
Inoue B-PER 
swore O 
to O 
' O 
avenge O 
' O 
his O 
father O 
's O 
death O 
with O 
kindness O 
. O 

He O 
ended O 
up O 
living O 
38 O 
years O 
among O 
the O 
aborigines O 
, O 
not O 
even O 
returning O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
when O 
his O 
mother O 
passed O 
away O 
. O 

He O 
finally O 
left O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
in O 
1947 O 
. O 

When O 
I O 
went O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
last O 
January O 
and O 
paid O 
my O 
respects O 
at O 
his O 
grave O 
, O 
I O 
discovered O 
that O 
his O 
gravestone O 
was O 
inscribed O 
in O 
Atayal O 
. O 

Teng B-PER 
had O 
been O 
planning O 
to O 
pass O 
the O 
torch O 
to O 
others O 
, O 
both O 
in O 
community O 
affairs O 
and O 
in O 
his O 
efforts O 
to O 
collect O 
the O 
oral O 
histories O 
of O 
the O 
aborigines O 
. O 

" O 
I O 
've O 
done O 
my O 
bit O 
, O 
" O 
said O 
Teng B-PER 
, O 
" O 
and O 
soon O 
it O 
will O 
be O 
time O 
to O 
let O 
the O 
aborigines O 
speak O 
for O 
themselves O 
. O 
" O 

Then O 
the O 
earthquake O 
threw O 
a O 
wrench O 
in O 
Teng B-PER 
's O 
plans O 
. O 

After O 
his O 
medical O 
laboratory O 
was O 
destroyed O 
, O 
Teng B-PER 
characteristically O 
reacted O 
by O 
throwing O 
his O 
energies O 
into O 
the O 
task O 
of O 
rebuilding O 
the O 
local O 
community O 
. O 

He O 
has O 
kept O 
himself O 
busy O 
preparing O 
posters O 
, O 
organizing O 
a O 
community O

establishing O

Teng B-PER 
, O 
" O

" O 

The O 
effort O 
to O 
rebuild O 
the O 
community O 
takes O 
precedence O 
over O 
everything O 
else O 
, O 
so O 
it O 
looks O 
like O 
Teng B-PER 
's O 
writing O 
plans O

have O 
to O 
be O 
postponed O

Teng B-PER

the O

never O 
fade O

Last O

at O

" O

entitled O 
" O 
National O 
Defense O 
Strategy O 
and O 
Construction O 
in O 
the O 
New O 
Century O 
. O 
" O 

He O 
suggested O 
that O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
will O 
have O 
to O 
develop O 
long O 
- O 
range O 
missiles O 
to O 
counter O 
the O 
mainland O 
Chinese O 
military O 
threat O 
. O 

While O 
" O 
effective O 
deterrence O 
" O 
would O 
remain O 
the O 
cornerstone O 
of O 
strategy O 
, O 
it O 
should O 
no O 
longer O 
be O 
passive O 
, O 
said O 
Lien B-PER 
, O 
but O 
" O 
pro-active O 
. O 
" O 

Chen B-PER 
raised O 
a O 
similar O 
idea O 
. O 

Obviously O 
, O 
after O 
the O 
experience O 
of O 
the O 
1996 O 
Taiwan O 
Strait O 
missile O 
crisis O 
, O 
people O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
have O 
considered O 
defending O 
the O 
island O 
against O 
mainland O 
Chinese O 
missile O 
attack O 
to O 
be O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
foremost O 
defense O 
problems O 
. O 

Interestingly O 
, O 
even O 
as O 
such O 
" O 
pro-active O 
defense O 
" O 
ideas O 
are O 
being O 
proposed O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
Ministry I-ORG 
of I-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Defense I-ORG 
-LRB- O 
MND B-ORG 
-RRB- O 
has O 
made O 
a O 
seemingly O 
contrary O 
move O 
: O 
It O 
has O 
announced O 
that O 
military O 
forces O 
will O 
be O 
withdrawn O 
from O 
the O 
remote O 
offshore O 
Pratas B-LOC 
and O 
Spratley B-LOC 
islands I-LOC 
, O 
and O 
that O 
responsibility O 
for O 
these O 
islands O 
and O 
for O 
coastal O 
patrolling O 
will O 
be O 
transferred O 
to O 
the B-ORG 
Coast I-ORG 
Guard I-ORG 
. O 

The O 
MND B-ORG 
argues O 
that O 
since O 
the O 
military O 
is O 
being O 
streamlined O 
, O 
in O 
order O 
to O 
concentrate O 
defense O 
forces O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
, O 
Penghu B-LOC 
, O 
Kinmen B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
Matsu B-LOC 
, O 
the O 
defense O 
of O 
the O 
Pratas B-LOC 
and O 
Spratley B-LOC 
islands I-LOC 
- O 
which O 
are O 
in O 
the B-LOC 
South I-LOC 
China I-LOC 
Sea I-LOC 
- O 
and O 
the O 
protection O 
of O 
coastal O 
fishing O 
vessels O 
and O 
coastal O 
security O 
should O 
be O 
left O 
to O 
the B-ORG 
Coast I-ORG 
Guard I-ORG 
. O 

The O 
stimulus O 
for O 
these O 
new O 
ideas O 
has O 
been O 
the O 
aggressive O 
military O 
deployments O 
by O 
mainland O 
China B-LOC 
aimed O 
at O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
. O

, O 
says O 
that O 
the O 
successful O 
testing O 
by O 
mainland O 
China B-LOC 
of O 
missiles O 
in O 
1996 O 
has O 
altered O 
the O 
lines O 
of O 
strategic O 
thought O 
on O 
both O 
sides O 
of O 
the O 
strait O 
. O 

Guided O 
missiles O 
have O 
replaced O 
aircraft O 
as O 
the O 
major O 
threat O 
to O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
. O 

In O 
recent O 
years O 
mainland O 
China B-LOC 
has O 
also O 
constructed O 
short O 
- O 
range O 
surface O 
- O

surface O 
missile O 
bases O 
along O 
its O 
Southeast B-LOC 
Coast I-LOC 
which O 
are O 
specifically O 
targeted O 
at O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
. O 

According O 
to O 
a O 
report O 
in O 
the O 
December O 
22 O 
, O 
1999 O 
Washington B-ORG 
Post I-ORG 
, O 
in O 
November O 
US B-LOC 
reconnaissance O

discovered O 
that O 
the O

begun O 
constructing O

Lin B-PER

says O 
that O 
, O 
besides O 
rapidly O 
building O 
missile O 
bases O 
, O 
the O 
PRC B-LOC 
has O 
repeatedly O 
stated O 
that O 
" O 
there O 
should O 
be O 
a O 
timetable O 
for O 
resolution O 
of O 
the O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
problem O

" O 

The O 
PRC B-LOC 
's O 
extremely O 
assertive O 
deployment O 
of O 
armed O 
capability O 
opposite O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
is O 
deeply O 
felt O 
in O 
the O 
ROC B-LOC 
. O 

If O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
does O 
not O 
respond O 
in O 
time O 
, O 
it O 
will O 
be O 
forced O 
into O

notes O

for O

moment O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
still O 
has O 
a O 
slight O 
edge O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
air O 
defense O 
. O 

Although O 
this O 
prediction O 
is O 
not O 
necessarily O 
accurate O 
, O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
should O 
work O 
to O 
maintain O 
its O 
edge O

as O 
to O 
guarantee O 
peace O 
through O

Fuh B-PER 
Wei I-PER

offers O 
the O 
following O 
analysis O 
: O 
Currently O 
the O 
PRC B-LOC 
weapons O 
which O 
pose O 
the O 
greatest O 
threat O 
to O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
are O 
Sukhoi O 
aircraft O 
, O 
M O 
- O 
class O 
missiles O 
, O 
and O 
cruise O 
missiles O 
. O 

Of O 
these O 
, O 
the O 
aircraft O 
are O 
already O 
strategically O 
of O 
the O 
second O 
rank O 
, O 
but O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
must O 
be O 
alert O 
to O 
the O 
missiles O 
. O 

The O 
M O 
- O 
class O 
weapons O 
can O 
pass O 
through O 
the O 
stratosphere O 
directly O 
into O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
rear O 
areas O 
, O 
while O 
cruise O 
missiles O 
can O 
undertake O 
low O 
- O 
level O 
long O 
- O 
range O 
attacks O 
. O 

From O 
the O 
point O 
of O 
view O 
of O 
international O 
strategy O 
, O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
clearly O 
does O 
not O 
want O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
to O 
develop O 
its O 
own O 
offensive O 
missile O 
capability O 
. O 

The O 
US B-LOC 
responded O 
negatively O 
to O 
Lien B-PER 
Chan I-PER 
's I-PER 
proposal O 
to O 
build O 
long O 
- O 
range O 
missiles O 
. O 

At O 
the B-ORG 
State I-ORG 
Department I-ORG 
's I-ORG 
end O 
- O 
of O 
- O 
year O 
press O 
conference O 
, O 
US B-LOC 
Under O 
Secretary O 
of O 
State B-ORG 
for O 
Arms O 
Control O 
John B-PER 
Holum I-PER 
said O 
that O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
did O 
not O 
want O 
to O 
see O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
take O 
any O 
action O 
which O 
would O 
violate O 
the O 
basic O 
norms O 
of O 
the O 
1987 O

Thus O 
the O 
US B-LOC

not O 
be O

offensive O 
long O

's O 
long O

range O 
strategy O 
vis O 
- O 
a O 
- O 
vis O 
China B-LOC 
. O 

The O 
US B-LOC 
has O 
always O 
been O 
responsible O 
for O 
strategic O 
deterrence O 
, O 
while O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
handles O 
local O 
tactical O 
defense O 
. O 

If O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
were O 
to O 
develop O 
long O 
- O 
range O 
missiles O 
, O 
this O 
would O 
change O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
defensive O 
posture O 
, O 
and O 
alter O 
the O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
- O 
US B-LOC 
military O 
division O 
of O

. O 

There O 
is O 
another O 
possibility O 
for O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
in O 
defending O 
against O 
the O 
threat O 
of O 
missiles O 
from O 
the O 
PRC B-LOC 
. O 

Besides O 
building O 
offensive O 
systems O 
, O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
could O 
also O 
join O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
Theater B-ORG 
Missile I-ORG 
Defense I-ORG 
-LRB- O 
TMD B-ORG 
-RRB- O 
plan O 
. O 

But O 
this O 
may O 
not O 
be O 
feasible O 
, O 
says O 
Bih B-PER 
Chung I-PER 
- I-PER 
ho I-PER 
, O 
editor O

in O 
- O 
chief O 
of O 
the O

magazine O 
Defense B-ORG 
Technology I-ORG 
Monthly I-ORG 
. O 

He O 
says O 
that O 
if O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
were O 
to O 
join O 
the O 
TMD B-ORG 
this O 
would O 
be O 
a O 
return O 
to O 
a O 
situation O 
of O 
joint O 
US B-LOC 
- O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
defense O 
, O 
such O 
as O 
existed O 
during O 
the O 
Cold O 
War O 
, O 
when O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
was O 
on O 
the O 
frontline O 
in O 
a O 
chain O 
of O 
islands O 
surrounding O 
China B-LOC 
. O 

For O 
the O 
PRC B-LOC 
, O 
which O 
is O 
endeavoring O 
to O 
move O 
from O 
coastal O 
defense O 
to O 
a O 
blue O 
- O 
water O 
capability O 
, O 
the O 
provocation O 
would O 
be O 
enormous O 
. O 

The B-LOC 
United I-LOC 
States I-LOC 
has O 
thus O 
been O 
deliberately O 
unclear O 
- O 
it O 
does O 
not O 
exclude O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
from O 
the O 
TMD B-ORG 
, O 
but O 
it O 
has O 
not O 
clearly O 
said O 
that O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
would O 
be O 
included O 
. O 

In O 
any O 
case O 
, O 
says O 
Lin B-PER 
Chong I-PER 
- I-PER 
pin I-PER 
, O 
vice-chairman O 
of O 
the O 
ROC B-LOC 
's O 
Mainland B-ORG 
Affairs I-ORG 
Council I-ORG 
, O 
potential O 
TMD B-ORG 
buyers O 
still O 
do O 
not O 
know O 
where O 
the O 
money O 
would O 
come O 
from O 
, O 
while O 
the O 
TMD B-ORG 
producer O 
has O 
not O 
yet O 
come O 
up O 
with O 
a O 
finished O 
product O 
. O 

So O 
this O 
is O 
still O 
just O 
a O 
political O 
debating O 
point O 
, O 
and O 
it O 
is O 
too O 
early O 
to O 
talk O 
about O 
any O 
impact O 
on O 
the O 
military O 
situation O 
in O 
the B-LOC 
Taiwan I-LOC 
Strait I-LOC 
. O 

Thus O 
, O 
from O 
the O 
international O 
strategic O 
angle O 
, O 
it O 
still O 
seems O 
most O 
practical O 
for O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
to O 
have O 
its O 
own O 
missile O 
systems O 
. O 

In O 
an O 
analysis O 
of O 
the O 
threat O 
that O 
guided O 
missiles O 
pose O 
to O 
morale O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
, O 
ROC B-LOC 
Minister O 
of O 
Defense O 
Tang B-PER 
Fei I-PER 
points O 
out O 
that O 
perhaps O 
for O 
some O 
countries O 
a O 
missile O 
attack O 
would O 
have O 
little O 
impact O 
. O 

But O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
, O 
where O 
resources O 
are O 
concentrated O 
, O 
missiles O 
pose O 
a O 
serious O 
threat O 
to O 
electrical O 
power O 
and O 
petroleum O 
production O 
, O 
to O 
transportation O 
-LRB- O

, O

, O

-RRB- O 
, O 
and O 
to O

. O 

More O 
importantly O 
, O 
he O 
says O 
, O 
the O 
citizens O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
are O 
not O 
psychologically O 
prepared O 
. O 

If O 
the O 
PRC B-LOC 
were O 
to O 
launch O 
200 O 
- O 
300 O 
guided O 
missiles O 
against O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
, O 
although O 
the O 
damage O 
to O 
industry O 
, O 
power O 
, O 
and O 
communications O 
would O 
probably O 
not O 
be O 
as O 
serious O 
as O 
was O 
caused O 
by O 
the O 
September O 
21 O 
earthquake O 
, O 
citizens O 
are O 
not O 
psychologically O 
prepared O 
for O

, O 
and O 
the O

might O 
not O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
withstand O 
the O

. O 

Chung B-PER

that O 
the O

The O

the O

in O

If O

currently O 
studying O 
is O 
a O 
way O 
of O 
pursuing O 
peace O 
. O 

Taiwan B-LOC 
will O 
not O 
provoke O 
mainland O 
China B-LOC 
, O 
nor O 
be O 
the O 
first O 
to O 
resort O 
to O 
war O 
. O 

But O 
nor O 
can O 
it O 
allow O 
the O 
PRC B-LOC 
to O 
think O 
that O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
is O 
so O 
weak O 
that O 
the O 
PRC B-LOC 
will O 
be O 
tempted O 
to O 
act O 
rashly O 
. O 

Pro-active O 
defense O 
is O 
necessary O 
for O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
, O 
but O 
the O 
real O 
goal O 
of O 
the O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
side O 
is O 
peace O 
. O 

Perhaps O 
militarily O 
there O 
's O 
a O 
standoff O 
situation O 
of O 
mutual O 
intimidation O 
, O 
but O 
what O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
most O 
hopes O 
for O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
cross-strait O 
problem O 
can O 
be O 
peacefully O 
resolved O 
without O 
deploying O 
a O 
single O 
soldier O 
. O 

The O 
crisis O 
sparked O 
by O 
PRC B-LOC 
missile O 
tests O 
pushed O 
the O 
security O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
to O 
the O 
top O 
of O 
the O 
issue O 
list O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
ticket O 
of O

and O 
Lien B-PER 
Chan I-PER 
of O 
the O 
ruling O 
Kuomintang B-ORG 
, O 
which O 
promised O 
stability O 
, O 
won O 
the O 
election O 
with O 
54 O 
% O 
of O 
the O 
vote O 
. O 

But O 
none O 
of O 
the O 
five O

advocating O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
independence O 
, O 
and O 
, O 
among O 
the O 
three O 
main O 
contenders O 
, O 
there O 
is O 
a O 
race O 
for O 
the O 
center O

All O

proposed O

to O 
maintain O 
peace O 
and O

in O 
the B-LOC

" O 
James B-PER

advocated O 
the O 
signing O 
of O 
a O 
peace O 
treaty O 
with O 
the O

and O 
Chen B-PER

announced O 
that O 
if O

will O 
not O 
declare O

seek O 
to O 
have O 
the O 
" O

inserted O

In O 
1996 O 
, O 
President O 
Lee B-PER

was O 
far O 
ahead O 
of O 
his O 
rivals O 
all O 
the O 
way O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
election O 
was O 
lopsided O 
. O 

Taking O 
advantage O 
of O 
the O 
Chinese O 
New O 
Year O 
, O 
many O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
businessmen O 
working O 
in O 
the O 
PRC B-LOC 
returned O 
to O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
to O 
spend O 
the O 
holiday O 
with O 
their O

Just O 
after O

year O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
Mainland I-ORG

and O 
several O 
non-governmental O

co-sponsored O 
a O 
seminar O 
on O 
economic O 
relations O 
with O 
mainland O 
China B-LOC 
. O 

They O 
invited O 
a O 
number O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
businessmen O 
who O 
were O 
among O 
the O 
earliest O 
to O 
invest O 
in O 
the O 
PRC B-LOC 
to O 
come O 
to O 
the O 
seminar O 
and O 
relate O 
their O 
experiences O 
. O 

Will O 
the O 
election O 
affect O 
willingness O 
to O 
invest O 
in O 
the O 
PRC B-LOC 
? O 

Most O 
of O 
the O

expressed O 
optimism O

later O 
this O

, O 
relations O 
between O 
the O

steadily O 
improve O

Maintaining O 
peaceful O 
relations O 
across O 
the B-LOC 
Taiwan I-LOC

is O 
the O 
common O 
hope O 
of O 
the O 
vast O 
majority O 
of O 
the O 
people O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC

When O 
you O 
talk O 
about O 
21st O 
century O 
leadership O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
, O 
cross-strait O 
policy O 
is O 
the O 
most O 
serious O 
subject O 
that O 
politicians O 
must O 
face O 
, O 
because O 
it O 
involves O 
the O 
very O 
survival O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
. O 

" O 
However O 
, O 
because O 
this O 
subject O 
touches O 
on O 
the O 
question O 
of O 
the O

loyalty O

of O 
the O

well O

" O

has O

early O

ten O

, O 
which O 
advocates O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
independence O 
, O 
produced O 
a O 
long O

detailed O 
white O 
paper O 
on O

which O 
offered O 
some O

But O 
, O 
in O 
an O 
unguarded O 
moment O 
, O 
Chen B-PER 
also O 
declared O 
" O 
Long O

and O 
this O 
comment O

left O

uncertain O

is O 
the O 
real O 
Chen B-PER

James B-PER 
Soong I-PER

suggested O 
defining O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
- O 
PRC B-LOC 
links O 
as O 
a O 
" O 
quasi-international O 
relationship O 
. O 
" O 

This O 
aims O 
for O 
a O 
middle O 
ground O 
between O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG

" O 
two O 
states O

" O 
one O

that O

appeal O 
to O

the O 
international O 
community O

But O 
this O 
idea O 
has O 
been O 
criticized O 
for O 
unilaterally O 
reducing O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
to O 
the O 
status O 
of O

" O 
thereby O 
weakening O

Chan I-PER

" O 
says O 
Wang B-PER

This O 
is O 
because O 
over O

a O 
consensus O

" O 

He O 
adds O 
, O 
" O 
Taiwan B-LOC

a O 
pluralistic O

you O 
ca O

this O

Wang B-PER

that O 
it O 
will O 
be O 
a O 
decisive O 
factor O 
in O 
the O

" O 
There O 
is O 
a O 
very O 
curious O 
aspect O 
to O

electoral O 
culture O 
, O 
" O 
explains O 
Wang B-PER

Taiwan B-LOC

That O 
is O 
why O 
when O

to O 
Sanhsia B-LOC

says O 
that O 
controversy O 
over O 
James B-PER

goes O 
back O 
to O 
the O 
days O 
when O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
ruled O

repressed O

When O 
Soong B-PER

KMT B-ORG 
secretary O

, O 
he O 
was O 
powerful O 
and O 
aloof O 
; O 
the O 
only O 
way O 
to O

an O

During O

KMT B-ORG 
between O 
the O

the O 
non-mainstream O

Soong B-PER

In O 
clearing O

" O 

Soong B-PER 
is O 
especially O 
good O 
at O 
timing O

Kuo B-PER 
recalls O 
several O 
such O 
opportune O 
moments O 
when O 
Soong B-PER 
was O 
provincial O 
governor O 
. O 

For O 
example O 
, O 
he O 
criticized O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG

over O 
the O

status O 
assigned O 
to O

also O 
over O

Although O

Kuo B-PER

" O 
If O

Chen B-PER 
was O 
a O 
sharp O

As O

his O 
manner O 
was O 
often O 
perceived O

this O

" O 
Chen B-PER 
fulfilled O

As O 
Wang B-PER 
puts O 
it O 
: O 
" O 
Perhaps O

would O 
say O 
that O

whether O

However O 
, O

he O 
will O 
ask O

" O 
He O

not O 
clear O

" O 
says O

who O 
opines O 
that O

" O

good O 
at O 
finding O 
the O

up O

As O 
for O 
James B-PER 
Soong I-PER 
, O 
" O 
His O 
policies O 
are O 
more O 
for O

the O

give O 
more O 
thought O 
to O 
the O

" O 

Soong B-PER 
has O 
taken O 
into O 
account O 
the O 
long O

existing O 
disparity O

private O

Ting B-PER 
admits O 
that O 
in O 
evaluating O

the O 
incumbent O 
, O 
Lien B-PER 
Chan I-PER 
, O 
is O 
at O 
a O 
relative O 
disadvantage O 
, O 
because O 
the O

currently O

open O

scrutiny O

According O 
to O 
Ting B-PER

" O

been O 
at O 
odds O

for O 
a O 
long O 
time O 
. O 
" O 

" O 
Lien B-PER 
is O 
also O 
the O 
candidate O 
who O 
is O 
most O 
likely O 
to O 
believe O 
that O

can O 
be O 
solved O 
by O 
throwing O 
money O 
at O 
them O 
, O 
" O

Lien B-PER 
has O 
stated O 
that O 
he O 
wants O 
to O 
extend O 
compulsory O

12 O

: O 
" O 
He O 
has O 
lost O

although O

not O 
a O 
panacea O

it O 
is O 
certainly O

The O

for O

remains O 
the O 
other O

of O

" O 
In O 
the O 
past O 
two O

Taiwan B-LOC

The O 
most O

In O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
" O 
quiet O 
revolution O 
" O 
of O 
democratization O 
, O 
the O 
people O 
have O 
participated O 
enthusiastically O 
, O 
but O 
not O 
irrationally O 
. O 

Now O 
that O 
there O 
are O 
two O 
strong O 
parties O 
, O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
and O 
DPP B-ORG 
, O 
the O 
slogan O 
of O 
" O 
peaceful O 
rotation O 
of O 
political O 
parties O 
in O 
power O 
" O 
has O 
become O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
most O 
widely O 
used O 
appeals O 
for O 
the O 
opposition O 
. O 

In O 
the O 
middle O 
of O 
March O 
, O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
will O 
select O 
the O 
president O 
who O 
will O 
lead O 
the O 
island O 
into O 
the O 
new O 
century O 
. O 

But O 
the O 
election O 
, O 
besides O 
affecting O 
the O 
future O 
direction O 
of O 
the O 
country O 
, O 
has O 
another O 
rarely O 
mentioned O 
dimension O 
: O 
Since O 
the O 
three O 
major O 
candidates O 
Lien B-PER 
Chan I-PER 
, O 
Chen B-PER 
Shui I-PER 
- I-PER 
bian I-PER 
, O 
and O 
James B-PER 
Soong I-PER 
are O 
running O 
roughly O 
equal O 
, O 
this O 
suggests O 
that O 
after O 
the O 
election O 
there O 
may O 
be O 
a O 
restructuring O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
political O 
party O 
system O 
. O 

The O 
people O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
are O 
selecting O 
not O 
only O 
their O 
future O 
leaders O 
, O 
but O 
are O 
choosing O 
a O 
new O 
direction O 
for O 
party O 
politics O 
and O 
democratic O 
development O 
. O 

What O 
is O 
it O 
about O 
the O 
political O 
environment O 
that O 
means O 
that O 
the O 
election O 
for O 
the O 
president O 
of O 
the O 
ROC B-LOC 
, O 
which O 
was O 
not O 
conceived O 
as O 
a O 
presidential O 
system O 
, O 
will O 
affect O 
the O 
future O 
development O 
of O 
the O 
country O 
? O 

In O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
in O 
the O 
year O 
2000 O 
, O 
there O 
are O 
many O 
challenges O 
: O 

Although O 
entry O 
into O 
the B-ORG 
World I-ORG 
Trade I-ORG 
Organization I-ORG 
will O 
create O 
a O 
new O 
situation O 
in O 
the B-LOC 
Taiwan I-LOC 
Strait I-LOC 
, O 
the O 
two O 
sides O 
remain O 
in O 
an O 
obscure O 
relationship O 
that O 
is O 
neither O 
war O 
nor O 
peace O 
. O 

Taiwan B-LOC 
must O 
come O 
up O 
with O 
a O 
comprehensive O 
policy O 
that O 
considers O 
economic O 
, O 
diplomatic O 
, O 
and O 
military O 
factors O

out O 
that O 
, O 
after O 
a O 
long O 
era O 
of O 
rule O 
by O 
virtually O 
unchallenged O 
leaders O 
, O 
the O

is O 
looking O 
for O 
more O 
choice O 
. O 

At O 
the O 
top O 
, O 
this O 
election O 
is O 
a O 
contest O 
among O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
second O 
- O 
generation O 
political O 
elites O 
. O 

Underneath O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
a O 
struggle O 
among O 
the O 
various O 
forces O 
that O 
currently O 
exist O 
in O

society O 
. O 

The O 
KMT B-ORG

Lee B-PER

the O

is O 
the O 
greatest O

the O

split O 
away O

He O

of O

sentiment O

led O 
to O 
the O 
creation O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
New I-ORG

several O 
years O

. O 

Soong B-PER

has O 
opened O 
up O 
new O 
fault O 
lines O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC

party O 
politics O 
, O 
and O 
has O

of O 
many O

other O 
non-KMT B-ORG

non-DPP B-ORG 
forces O

The B-ORG 
New I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
itself O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
on O 
the O 
edge O 
of O 
collapse O 
, O 
has O 
nominated O 
the O 
renowned O 
author O 
Li B-PER 
Ao I-PER 
as O 
its O 
candidate O 
, O 
though O 
Li B-PER

of O

, O 
withdrew O 
from O 
the O 
DPP B-ORG

is O 
running O

Since O

began O 
in O 
earnest O 
, O 
Lien B-PER 
, O 
Chen B-PER 
, O 
and O 
Soong B-PER 
have O 
been O 
getting O 
roughly O 
similar O 
numbers O

with O 
about O 
a O

that O

, O 
under O

notes O 
that O 
the O 
president O 
had O 
always O 
enjoyed O 
a O 
number O 
of O 
special O 
powers O 
: O 
appointing O

But O 
recent O 
constitutional O

also O 
give O 
the O

President O

exercise O 
of O 
such O 
powers O

not O 
proved O

states O 
that O

no O

base O 
their O 
choice O 
primarily O 
on O

This O

The B-ORG

this O

If O

during O 
Lee B-PER

beneath O

there O 
lurks O 
a O 
major O 
threat O 
to O

: O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
's O 
" O 
black O 
gold O 
politics O 
. O 
" O 

Explains O 
Chang B-PER 
: O 
The O 
DPP B-ORG 
has O 
never O 
had O 
the O 
chance O 
to O 
be O 
the O 
ruling O 
party O 
, O 
and O 
therefore O 
has O 
never O 
been O 
in O 
a O 
position O 
to O 
fulfill O 
its O 
function O 
of O 
restraining O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
. O 

The O 
result O 
of O 
this O 
long O 
- O 
term O 
trend O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
is O 
" O 
overnourished O 
" O 
by O 
feeding O 
on O 
the O 
resources O 
of O 
the O 
state O 
and O 
society O 
while O 
the O 
opposition O 
parties O 
are O 
" O 
undernourished O 
. O 
" O 

Chang B-PER 
says O 
if O 
there O 
were O 
a O 
transfer O 
of O 
power O 
, O 
the O 
opposition O 
would O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
understand O 
more O 
clearly O 
the O 
actual O 
difficulties O 
of O 
governing O 
and O 
to O 
see O 
more O 
clearly O 
the O 
dark O 
corners O 
that O 
need O 
to O 
be O 
cleaned O 
out O 
. O 

Meanwhile O 
, O 
the O 
ruling O 
party O 
, O 
with O 
its O 
rich O 
experience O 
in O 
governing O 
, O 
would O 
be O 
very O 
qualified O 
to O 
play O 
the O 
role O 
of O 
overseeing O 
the O 
DPP B-ORG 
, O 
and O 
a O 
defeat O 
for O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
could O 
also O 
promote O 
its O 
internal O 
reassessment O 
and O 
reform O 
. O 

Were O 
Chen B-PER 
Shui I-PER 
- I-PER 
bian I-PER 
to O 
win O 
, O 
though O 
the O 
DPP B-ORG 
would O 
take O 
control O 
of O 
the O 
executive O 
branch O 
, O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
current O 
two O 
- O 
major O 
- O 
plus O 
- O 
one O 
- O 
minor O 
party O 
structure O 
would O 
probably O 
not O 
change O 
very O 
much O 
. O 

Chen B-PER 
Wen I-PER 
- I-PER 
cheng I-PER 
says O 
that O 
a O 
Chen B-PER 
victory O 
would O 
have O 
its O 
greatest O 
impact O 
on O 
the B-ORG 
New I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
- O 
and O 
that O 
the O 
effect O 
would O 
be O 
positive O 
. O 

After O 
an O 
impressive O 
start O 
, O 
the O 
NP B-ORG 
has O 
faded O 
steadily O 
over O 
the O 
past O 
few O 
elections O 
, O 
and O 
suffered O 
an O 
especially O 
sharp O 
blow O 
in O 
the O 
election O 
for O 
mayor O 
of O 
Taipei B-LOC 
two O 
years O 
ago O 
. O 

NP B-ORG 
votes O 
drifted O 
to O 
Ma B-PER 
Ying I-PER 
- I-PER 
jeou I-PER 
, O 
a O 
member O 
of O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
-LRB- O 
albeit O 
not O 
one O 
of O 
Lee B-PER 
Teng I-PER 
- I-PER 
hui I-PER 
's I-PER 
personal O 
favorites O 
-RRB- O 
. O 

The O 
NP B-ORG 
candidate O 
received O 
only O 
an O 
anemic O 
percentage O 
of O 
the O 
ballots O 
, O 
bringing O 
the O 
party O 
to O 
the O 
edge O 
of O 
collapse O 
. O 

But O 
if O 
Chen B-PER 
Shui I-PER 
- I-PER 
bian I-PER 
becomes O 
president O 
, O 
because O 
the O 
DPP B-ORG 
is O 
seen O 
as O 
the O 
party O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
independence O 
- O 
the O 
direct O 
antithesis O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
New I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
- O 
this O 
could O 
inspire O 
NP B-ORG 
members O 
to O 
pull O 
together O 
, O 
and O 
at O 
the O 
same O 
time O 
give O 
the O 
party O 
the O 
status O 
and O 
ability O 
to O 
absorb O 
the O 
forces O 
that O 
are O 
backing O 
James B-PER 
Soong I-PER 
. O 

If O 
Chen B-PER 
Shui I-PER 
- I-PER 
bian I-PER 
is O 
elected O 
, O 
his O 
biggest O 
challenge O 
will O 
come O 
from O 
the B-ORG 
Legislative I-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
, O 
and O 
the O 
first O 
problem O 
will O 
be O 
naming O 
a O 
premier O 
. O 

Although O 
the O 
constitution O 
stipulates O 
that O 
the O 
president O 
does O 
not O 
need O 
the O 
approval O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Legislative I-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
to O 
name O 
a O 
premier O 
, O 
given O 
the O 
fact O 
that O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
has O 
a O 
majority O 
there O 
, O 
Chen B-PER 
faces O 
the O 
problem O 
of O 
finding O 
a O 
premier O 
who O 
will O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
work O 
with O 
KMT B-ORG 
legislators O 
. O 

The O 
Chen B-PER 
camp O 
is O 
well O 
aware O 
of O 
this O 
problem O 
. O 

Therefore O 
they O 
have O 
let O 
it O 
be O 
known O 
that O 
Chen B-PER 
would O 
like O 
to O 
ask O 
Lee B-PER 
Yuan I-PER 
- I-PER 
tse I-PER 
, O 
the O 
universally O 
respected O 
Nobel O 
Prize O 
winner O 
who O 
is O 
currently O 
president O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Academia I-ORG 
Sinica I-ORG 
, O 
to O 
be O 
his O 
premier O 
. O 

Chen B-PER 
, O 
who O 
knows O 
that O 
within O 
the O 
DPP B-ORG 
there O 
is O 
little O 
high O 
- O 
level O 
governing O 
experience O 
, O 
has O 
repeatedly O 
raised O 
the O 
idea O 
of O 
a O 
" O 
coalition O 
government O 
. O 
" O 

However O 
, O 
it O 
should O 
be O 
noted O 
, O 
there O 
are O 
after O 
all O 
great O 
ideological O 
differences O 
between O 
the O 
DPP B-ORG 
and O 
the O 
other O 
parties O 
. O 

KMT B-ORG 
legislator O 
Li B-PER 
Hsien I-PER 
- I-PER 
jen I-PER 
points O 
out O 
that O 
the O 
DPP B-ORG 
retains O 
advocacy O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
independence O 
in O 
its O 
party O 
platform O 
, O 
and O 
DPP B-ORG 
vice-presidential O 
candidate O 
Annette B-PER 
Lu I-PER 
is O 
well O 
known O 
for O 
her O 
support O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
independence O 
. O 

Alexander B-PER 
Lu I-PER 
agrees O 
that O 
a O 
Chen B-PER 
victory O 
could O 
lead O 
to O 
inter-branch O 
conflict O 
. O 

But O 
he O 
does O 
not O 
see O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
independence O 
as O 
the O 
main O 
flashpoint O 
. O 

Lu B-PER 
explains O 
: O 
" O 
Currently O 
the B-ORG 
Legislative I-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
is O 
filled O 
with O 
representatives O 
of O 
capital O 
. O 

When O 
it O 
comes O 
to O 
laws O 
that O 
directly O 
affect O 
their O 
personal O 
privileges O 
and O 
interests O 
, O 
even O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
is O 
powerless O 
to O 
control O 
them O 
. O 

Chen B-PER 
Shui I-PER 
- I-PER 
bian I-PER 
has O 
repeatedly O 
emphasized O 
that O 
he O 
intends O 
to O 
wipe O 
out O 
black O 
gold O 
politics O 
and O 
will O 
never O 
compromise O 
. O 

Lien B-PER 
Chan I-PER 
's I-PER 
burden O 

If O 
Lien B-PER 
Chan I-PER 
is O 
elected O 
, O 
the O 
party O 
- O 
politics O 
issues O 
most O 
deserving O 
of O 
attention O 
will O 
be O 
whether O 
this O 
hastens O 
the O 
demise O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
New I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
and O 
whether O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
party O 
organization O 
and O 
the O 
government O 
can O 
move O 
together O 
in O 
step O 
. O 

Lien B-PER 
is O 
seen O 
as O 
Lee B-PER 
Teng I-PER 
- I-PER 
hui I-PER 
's I-PER 
designated O 
successor O 
. O 

But O 
, O 
given O 
the O 
term O 
system O 
for O 
the O 
chairmanship O 
of O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
, O 
after O 
the O 
election O 
there O 
will O 
be O 
a O 
period O 
of O 
time O 
in O 
which O 
Lee B-PER 
remains O 
party O 
chairman O 
, O 
while O 
Lien B-PER 
is O 
president O 
. O 

Observers O 
are O 
very O 
curious O 
about O 
whether O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
has O 
in O 
fact O 
changed O 
, O 
or O 
whether O 
we O 
will O 
see O 
a O 
repeat O 
of O 
what O 
happened O 
back O 
in O 
the O 
late O 
1970s O 
: O 

At O 
that O 
time O 
Yen B-PER 
Chia I-PER 
- I-PER 
kan I-PER 
was O 
president O 
, O 
but O 
national O 
policy O 
was O 
in O 
fact O 
determined O 
by O 
Chiang B-PER 
Ching I-PER 
- I-PER 
kuo I-PER 
, O 
whose O 
authority O 
derived O 
from O 
his O 
post O 
as O 
party O 
chairman O 
and O 
who O 
took O 
the O 
position O 
of O 
premier O 
from O 
which O 
to O 
oversee O 
day O 
- O 
to O 
- O 
day O 
policy O 
- O 
making O 
. O 

As O 
Li B-PER 
Hsien I-PER 
- I-PER 
jen I-PER 
analyzes O 
the O 
situation O 
, O 
if O 
Lien B-PER 
Chan I-PER 
is O 
elected O 
, O 
there O 
will O 
indeed O 
be O 
a O 
transition O 
period O 
in O 
his O 
relations O 
with O 
Lee B-PER 
Teng I-PER 
- I-PER 
hui I-PER 
. O 

But O 
this O 
is O 
not O 
necessarily O 
a O 
bad O 
thing O 
for O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
. O 

Consider O 
, O 
says O 
Li B-PER 
, O 
the O 
fact O 
that O 
James B-ORG 
Soong I-ORG 
's I-ORG 
candidacy O 
has O 
raised O 
the O 
specter O 
of O 
a O 
party O 
split O 
. O 

A O 
victory O 
for O 
Lien B-PER 
, O 
with O 
Lee B-PER 
continuing O 
as O 
party O 
chairman O 
, O 
would O 
be O 
helpful O 
to O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
in O 
resolving O 
internal O 
party O 
disputes O 
, O 
and O 
in O 
consolidating O 
Lien B-PER 
's O 
party O 
and O 
government O 
position O 
. O 

He O 
says O 
that O 
it O 
is O 
unlikely O 
that O 
the O 
Yen B-PER 
- O 
Chiang B-PER 
situation O 
would O 
be O 
repeated O 
, O 
since O 
Lee B-PER 
Teng I-PER 
- I-PER 
hui I-PER 
will O 
certainly O 
not O 
have O 
an O 
office O 
like O 
premier O 
which O 
would O 
involve O 
him O 
in O 
day O 
- O 
to O 
- O 
day O 
policy O 
- O 
making O 
. O 

What O 
would O 
a O 
Lien B-PER 
victory O 
mean O 
for O 
the B-ORG 
New I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
? O 

Remember O 
that O 
the O 
NP B-ORG 
was O 
organized O 
primarily O 
out O 
of O 
opposition O 
to O 
Lee B-PER 
Teng I-PER 
- I-PER 
hui I-PER 
. O 

If O 
Lien B-PER 
Chan I-PER 
can O 
escape O 
from O 
Lee B-PER 
's O 
shadow O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
New I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
would O 
lose O 
its O 
original O 
purpose O 
, O 
and O 
members O 
could O 
possibly O 
return O 
to O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
, O 
restoring O 
the O 
two O 
- O 
party O 
system O 
that O 
reigned O 
before O 
the O 
NP B-ORG 
was O 
formed O 
. O 

Another O 
significant O 
possibility O 
is O 
that O 
New B-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
members O 
, O 
who O 
tend O 
to O 
support O 
James B-PER 
Soong I-PER 
, O 
could O 
organize O 
a O 
brand O 
- O 
new O 
political O 
party O 
with O 
remnant O 
Soong B-PER 
backers O 
after O 
the O 
election O 
. O 

Shao B-PER

- I-PER 
hai I-PER 
, O 
a O 
professor O 
at O 
National B-ORG 
Chengchih I-ORG 
University I-ORG 
and O 
a O 
campaign O 
staffer O 
for O 
James B-PER 
Soong I-PER 
, O 
states O 
: O 
Soong B-PER 
has O 
reiterated O 
that O 
he O 
personally O 
has O 
no O 
intention O 
of O 
organizing O 
a O 
new O 
political O 
party O 
after O 
the O 
election O 
. O 

Moreover O 
, O 
after O 
Lee B-PER 
Teng I-PER 
- I-PER 
hui I-PER 
leaves O 
the O 
scene O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
NP B-ORG 
no O 
longer O 
has O 
that O 
fixation O 
, O 
the O 
possibility O 
of O 
establishing O 
a O 
new O 
party O 
with O 
Soong B-PER 
's O 
other O 
supporters O 
-LRB- O 
who O 
by O 
no O 
means O 
necessarily O 
dislike O 
Lee B-PER 
-RRB- O 
increases O 
. O 

If O 
this O 
happens O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
New I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
will O 
no O 
longer O 
be O 
in O 
decline O 
as O 
it O 
is O 
now O 
, O 
but O 
will O 
re-emerge O 
as O 
a O 
force O 
to O 
be O 
reckoned O 
with O 
, O 
and O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
will O 
be O 
looking O 
at O 
a O 
true O 
three O 
- O 
party O 
system O 
. O 

If O 
Lien B-PER 
Chan I-PER 
is O 
elected O 
, O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
will O 
continue O 
to O 
hold O 
both O 
executive O 
power O 
and O 
a O 
legislative O 
majority O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
premier O 
will O 
serve O 
simply O 
as O 
the O 
chief O 
of O 
staff O 
to O 
the O 
president O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
based O 
on O 
current O 
public O 
opinion O 
polls O 
, O 
it O 
appears O 
that O 
whoever O 
wins O 
, O 
Lien B-PER 
included O 
, O 
will O 
be O 
only O 
a O 
" O 
plurality O 
president O 
, O 
" O 
without O 
a O 
strong O 
mandate O 
to O 
rule O 
. O 

Chang B-PER 
Chun I-PER 
- I-PER 
hung I-PER 
, O 
who O 
knows O 
the O 
legislative O 
environment O 
very O 
well O 
, O 
explains O 
: O 
" O 
Even O 
now O 
in O 
order O 
to O 
pass O 
important O 
legislation O 
there O 
must O 
be O 
compromise O 
and O 
negotiations O 
. O 

It O 
will O 
be O 
virtually O 
impossible O 
for O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
to O 
railroad O 
through O 
legislation O 
under O 
the O 
leadership O 
of O 
a O 
president O 
who O 
does O 
n't O 
enjoy O 
majority O 
public O 
support O 
. O 
" O 

This O 
would O 
, O 
at O 
least O 
on O 
paper O 
, O 
reduce O 
the O 
financial O 
leverage O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
would O 
have O 
over O 
its O 
legislators O 
, O 
and O 
KMT B-ORG 
representatives O 
could O 
become O 
even O 
more O 
difficult O 
for O 
the O 
party O 
to O 
control O 
. O 

Lien B-PER 
Chan I-PER 
may O 
face O 
the O 
problem O 
of O 
being O 
unable O 
to O 
enforce O 
the O 
decisions O 
of O 
the O 
party O 
center O 
. O 

If O 
Soong B-PER 
wins O 
. O 
. O 
. O 
. O 

Many O 
supporters O 
of O 
James B-PER 
Soong I-PER 
are O 
people O 
dissatisfied O 
with O 
the O 
current O 
state O 
of O 
the O 
main O 
parties O 
. O 

It O 
is O 
generally O 
believed O 
that O 
if O 
Soong B-PER 
wins O 
the O 
election O 
, O 
this O 
could O 
spark O 
a O 
dramatic O 
reorganization O 
of O 
party O 
politics O 
. O 

The O 
main O 
blow O 
could O 
fall O 
on O 
the B-ORG 
New I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
, O 
which O 
could O 
find O 
itself O 
made O 
irrelevant O 
, O 
with O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
also O 
strongly O 
affected O 
. O 

If O 
Soong B-PER 
wins O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
considered O 
virtually O 
inevitable O 
that O 
his O 
supporters O 
will O 
organize O 
some O 
sort O 
of O 
political O 
organization O 
. O 

Shao B-PER 
Tsung I-PER 
- I-PER 
hai I-PER 
says O 
frankly O 
that O 
, O 
even O 
if O 
Soong B-PER 
himself O 
does O 
not O 
lead O 
the O 
way O 
, O 
his O 
supporters O 
- O 
faced O 
with O 
the O 
reality O 
of O 
party O 
politics O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
- O 
would O 
have O 
to O 
organize O 
in O 
order O 
to O 
coordinate O 
their O 
operations O 
. O 

At O 
the O 
same O 
time O 
, O 
according O 
to O 
public O 
opinion O 
surveys O 
, O 
an O 
extremely O 
high O 
percentage O 
of O 
NP B-ORG 
members O 
support O 
Soong B-PER 
. O 

If O 
Soong B-PER 
wins O 
, O 
it O 
would O 
be O 
logical O 
for O 
these O 
people O 
to O 
leave O 
the O 
NP B-ORG 
and O 
join O 
forces O 
with O 
other O 
Soong B-PER 
backers O 
, O 
thereby O 
gutting O 
the B-ORG 
New I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
. O 

NP B-ORG 
secretary O 
- O 
general O 
Lee B-PER 
Ben I-PER 
- I-PER 
nan I-PER 
states O 
: O 
" O 
As O 
early O 
as O 
last O 
year O 
, O 
the O 
leadership O 
realized O 
that O 
our O 
party O 
could O 
potentially O 
disappear O 
" O 
if O 
Soong B-PER 
wins O 
. O 

But O 
Soong B-PER 
is O 
the O 
closest O 
of O 
the O 
three O 
main O 
candidates O 
to O 
the O 
NP B-ORG 
ideals O 
, O 
thus O 
putting O 
the O 
NP B-ORG 
in O 
a O 
dilemma O 
. O 

The O 
party O 
nominated O 
Li B-PER 
Ao I-PER 
to O 
maintain O 
the O 
party O 
profile O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
NP B-ORG 
leadership O 
still O 
calls O 
on O 
party O 
members O 
to O 
support O 
Li B-ORG 
, O 
but O 
also O 
says O 
it O 
will O 
understand O 
if O 
its O 
members O 
vote O 
for O 
another O 
candidate O 
. O 

If O 
Soong B-PER 
wins O 
, O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
could O 
also O 
be O 
thrown O 
into O 
crisis O 
. O 

In O 
this O 
election O 
, O 
several O 
leading O 
KMT B-ORG 
figures O 
have O 
publicly O 
come O 
out O 
in O 
favor O 
of O 
James B-PER 
Soong I-PER 
, O 
and O 
have O 
been O 
expelled O 
from O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
as O 
a O 
result O 
. O 

Though O 
these O 
could O 
be O 
explained O 
away O 
as O 
individuals O 
who O 
were O 
not O 
able O 
to O 
satisfy O 
their O 
personal O 
ambitions O 
inside O 
the O 
party O 
, O 
there O 
are O 
also O 
many O 
still O 
in O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
who O 
secretly O 
are O 
pro-Soong O 
. O 

If O 
elected O 
, O 
Soong B-PER 
will O 
have O 
a O 
wealth O 
of O 
government O 
resources O 
with O 
which O 
to O 
attract O 
even O 
more O 
people O 
to O 
openly O 
support O 
him O 
, O 
and O 
this O 
could O 
be O 
the O 
straw O 
that O 
breaks O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
's O 
back O 
. O 

Based O 
on O 
this O 
logic O 
, O 
Lin B-PER 
Wen I-PER 
- I-PER 
cheng I-PER 
says O 
that O 
an O 
era O 
of O 
three O 
- O 
party O 
politics O 
is O 
on O 
the O 
way O 
. O 

Though O 
it O 
is O 
impossible O 
to O 
say O 
whether O 
such O 
a O 
situation O 
would O 
be O 
stable O 
, O 
for O 
those O 
who O 
are O 
dissatisfied O 
with O 
the O 
current O 
choices O 
and O 
who O 
want O 
a O 
reshuffling O 
of O 
party O 
politics O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
, O 
this O 
is O 
the O 
opportunity O 
to O 
create O 
a O 
fresh O 
climate O 
. O 

Chang B-PER 
Chun I-PER 
- I-PER 
hung I-PER 
suggests O 
that O 
, O 
in O 
addition O 
to O 
uncertainty O 
in O 
party O 
politics O 
, O 
a O 
Soong B-PER 
victory O 
could O 
also O 
bring O 
instability O 
to O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
constitutional O 
system O 
. O 

Except O 
for O 
some O 
of O 
his O 
followers O 
who O 
were O 
with O 
him O 
in O 
the O 
provincial O 
government O 
, O 
Soong B-PER 
's O 
camp O 
lacks O 
any O 
experience O 
in O 
inter-group O 
political O 
bargaining O 
. O 

With O 
Soong B-PER 
as O 
president O 
, O 
political O 
elites O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
would O 
be O 
, O 
as O 
Alexander B-PER 
Lu I-PER 
describes O 
it O 
, O 
like O 
a O 
basketball O 
team O 
whose O 
players O 
have O 
never O 
played O 
together O 
before O 
. O 

Soong B-PER 
's O 
camp O 
will O 
first O 
have O 
to O 
integrate O 
their O 
own O 
internal O 
views O 
, O 
and O 
then O 
, O 
to O 
win O 
confidence O 
and O 
trust O 
from O 
the B-ORG 
Legislative I-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
, O 
work O 
with O 
both O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
and O 
the O 
DPP B-ORG 
. O 

Although O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
, O 
DPP B-ORG 
, O 
and O 
NP B-ORG 
all O 
have O 
legislators O 
who O 
might O 
join O 
the O 
Soong B-PER 
camp O 
if O 
Soong B-PER 
wins O 
, O 
Soong B-PER 
's O 
team O 
will O 
still O 
need O 
support O 
from O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
and/or O 
the O 
DPP B-ORG 
, O 
support O 
they O 
can O 
only O 
get O 
through O 
negotiation O 
. O 

Past O 
experience O 
has O 
shown O 
that O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
and O 
DPP B-ORG 
can O 
work O 
together O 
to O 
boycott O 
Executive B-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
proposals O 
; O 
if O 
they O 
do O 
this O 
to O 
a O 
Soong B-PER 
- O 
led O 
executive O 
branch O 
, O 
this O 
could O 
lead O 
to O 
a O 
crisis O 
ending O 
in O 
either O 
a O 
vote O 
of O 
no O 
confidence O 
or O 
dissolution O 
of O 
the O 
parliament O 
. O 

The O 
possibility O 
of O 
a O 
constitutional O 
crisis O 
looks O 
much O 
greater O 
under O 
Soong B-PER 
than O 
under O 
Chen B-PER 
Shui I-PER 
- I-PER 
bian I-PER 
or O 
Lien B-PER 
Chan I-PER 
. O 

That O 
is O 
why O 
Soong B-PER 
, O 
who O 
early O 
on O 
was O 
significantly O 
ahead O 
of O 
his O 
rivals O 
in O 
public O 
opinion O 
polls O 
, O 
saw O 
a O 
dramatic O 
drop O 
in O 
support O 
after O 
the O 
Chung B-ORG 
Hsing I-ORG 
Bills I-ORG 
scandal O 
broke O 
. O 

Chang B-PER 
Chun I-PER 
- I-PER 
hung I-PER 
adds O 
that O 
negative O 
election O 
tactics O 
, O 
which O 
after O 
all O 
may O 
be O 
seen O 
in O 
any O 
democratic O 
country O 
, O 
are O 
not O 
- O 
bad O 
as O 
they O 
are O 
- O 
the O 
biggest O 
threat O 
. O 

He O 
says O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
voters O 
should O 
most O 
be O 
on O 
the O 
lookout O 
for O 
the O 
" O 
one O 
of O 
us O 
" O 
effect O 
. O 

This O 
has O 
long O 
been O 
a O 
tactic O 
used O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
elections O 
. O 

As O 
a O 
result O 
, O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
ethnic O 
groups O 
are O 
pitted O 
against O 
one O 
another O 
politically O 
. O 

Lin B-PER 
Wen I-PER 
- I-PER 
cheng I-PER 
states O 
that O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
daily O 
life O 
, O 
differences O 
between O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
ethnic O 
groups O 
have O 
largely O 
disappeared O 
. O 

Lin B-PER 
contends O 
: O 
" O 
It O 
is O 
inevitable O 
that O 
minority O 
groups O 
in O 
any O 
society O 
feel O 
insecure O 
about O 
their O 
status O 
. O 

In O 
the O 
last O 
election O 
for O 
the O 
mayor O 
of O 
Taipei B-LOC 
, O 
it O 
was O 
obvious O 
that O 
virtually O 
all O 
mainlanders O 
voted O 
for O 
Ma B-PER 
Ying I-PER 
- I-PER 
jeou I-PER 
. O 

Because O 
the O 
majority O 
Taiwanese O 
do O 
not O 
feel O 
threatened O 
, O 
they O 
were O 
less O 
likely O 
to O 
vote O 
based O 
on O 
provincial O 
origin O 
, O 
giving O 
Ma B-PER 
enough O 
cross-over O 
votes O 
to O 
beat O 
out O 
Chen B-PER 
Shui I-PER 
- I-PER 
bian I-PER 
. O 

In O 
this O 
upcoming O 
election O 
, O 
James B-PER 
Soong I-PER 
[ O 
who O 
is O 
a O 
mainlander O 
] O 
is O 
also O 
getting O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
support O 
from O 
Hakka O 
people O 
, O 
who O 
sympathize O 
with O 
his O 
outsider O 
status O 
and O 
remember O 
his O 
support O 
for O 
Hakka O 
identity O 
. O 
" O 

In O 
the O 
2000 O 
election O 
, O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
will O 
not O 
only O 
be O 
choosing O 
a O 
new O 
leader O 
. O 

It O 
will O 
also O 
be O 
choosing O 
a O 
new O 
direction O 
for O

How O

the O 
main O 
difference O 
between O

: O 

Often O 
, O 
says O 
Lin B-PER

such O 
questions O 
leave O 
him O

In O

a O 
big O 
hit O 
with O 
over O 
30 O

, O 
taking O 
them O 
to O

over O 
ten O

of O

One O 
student O 
attending O 
a O 
non-degree O

that O

not O

The O 
NTUST B-ORG 
student O 
expresses O 
cynicism O 
toward O 
the O

and O 
review O

, O 
suspecting O 
that O 
" O 
they O 
just O 
pay O 
attention O 
to O

" O 

For O

, O 
NTU B-ORG 
divides O 
the O

three O

, O 
at O 
NT$ O 
50,000 O

gradually O 
put O 
down O

in O 
the O

In O 
the O

, O 
Shu B-PER

After O 
TCAC B-ORG 
was O 
officially O 
established O 
, O 
its O 
main O 
project O 
was O 
the O 
publication O 
of O 
a O 
bimonthly O 
newsletter O 
. O 

The B-ORG 
TCAC I-ORG 
Newsletter I-ORG 
provided O 
the O 
people O 
of O

with O 
an O 
opportunity O 
to O 
speak O

A O

, O 
" O 
I O 
used O 
to O 
have O 
a O 
job O 
in O 
another O 
town O 
, O 
and O 
every O 
time O 
I O 
came O 
back O 
to O 
Peipu B-LOC 
I O 
would O 
go O 
straight O 
to O 
the O

wolf O 
down O 
a O

, O 
keeping O 
the O

print O 
for O 
two O 
or O 
three O 
years O 
has O 
been O 
no O 
small O 
accomplishment O 
. O 

In O 
addition O 
to O 
the O 
newsletter O 
, O 
TCAC B-ORG 
has O 
also O 
been O 
involved O 
in O 
many O 
local O 
activities O 
. O 

" O 
A O

goes O 
on O 
in O

Hakka O

" O 
says O 
Shu B-PER 
, O 
adding O 
that O 
when O 
help O 
is O 
needed O 
the O 
locals O 
are O 
likely O 
to O 
contribute O 
not O 
just O 
money O 
but O 
something O 
even O 
more O 
valuable O 
- O 
their O 
time O 
and O 
energy O 
. O 

When O 
TCAC B-ORG 
puts O 
on O 
an O 
activity O 
, O 
for O 
example O 
, O 
if O 
someone O 
notices O 
that O 
an O 
event O 
organizer O 
is O 
getting O 
thirsty O 
they O 
will O 
immediately O 
bring O 
him O 
a O 
bottle O 
of O 
mineral O 
water O 
. O 

" O 
If O 
the O 
local O 
residents O 
agree O 
with O 
what O 
you O 
're O 
doing O 
, O 
they O 
're O 
sure O 
to O 
pitch O 
in O 
and O 
help O

" O 
says O 
Shu B-PER 
, O 
who O 
considers O 
this O 
spirit O 
of O 
volunteerism O 
much O 
more O 
valuable O 
than O 
monetary O 
donations O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
why O 
TCAC B-ORG 
has O 
been O 
able O 
to O 
carry O 
out O 
so O 
many O 
activities O 
over O 
the O 
past O 
three O 
years O 
without O 
spending O 
any O

Peipu B-LOC

taken O

enthusiastically O 
in O 
recycling O

post-harvest O

of O 
this O

even O 
drawn O

Most O

the O

The O

ever O 
be O 
exactly O 
the O

it O 
once O

the O

taught O 
the O

the O 
value O 
of O 
what O

Lin B-PER

says O 
there O 
are O 
two O 
viable O 
directions O 
to O 
get O 
into O 
the O 
Palau B-LOC 
tourism O 
industry O 
. O 

One O 
is O 
to O 
invest O 
in O 
a O 
tourism O 
- O 
related O 
industry O 
in O 
Palau B-LOC 
, O 
the O 
other O 
is O 
to O 
increase O 
the O 
number O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
tourists O 
and O 
extend O 
profit O 
opportunities O 
into O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
itself O 
. O 

Oddly O 
, O 
despite O 
Palau B-LOC 
's O 
beauty O 
, O 
in O 
the O 
past O 
few O 
years O 
tourism O 
has O 
dropped O 
off O 
considerably O 
. O 

In O 
1997 O 
, O 
there O 
were O 
more O 
than O 
70,000 O 
foreign O 
visits O 
to O 
Palau B-LOC 
. O 

Taiwan B-LOC 
has O 
been O 
, O 
along O 
with O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
main O 
sources O 
of O 
tourists O 
to O 
Palau B-LOC 
. O 

As O 
a O 
result O 
, O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
tourism O 
businesses O 
in O 
Palau B-LOC 
, O 
which O 
mainly O 
cater O 
to O 
Taiwanese B-LOC 
, O 
are O 
crying O 
uncle O 
. O 

" O 
It O 
's O 
not O 
only O 
the O 
hotel O 
industry O 
, O 
even O 
at O 
Chinese O 
restaurants O 
business O 
has O 
fallen O 
off O 
sharply O 
, O 
" O 
says O

. O 

Chu B-PER 
, O 
who O 
also O 
operates O 
a O 
tourist O 
agency O 
, O 
was O 
forced O 
to O 
move O 
the O 
Chinese O 
restaurant O 
she O 
had O 
run O 
for O 
many O 
years O 
to O 
much O 
smaller O 
premises O 
. O

, O 
deputy O 
director O 
- O 
general O 
of O 
the O 
ROC B-LOC 
Tourism B-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
, O 
says O 
that O 
a O 
major O 
reason O 
why O 
profit O 
margins O 
have O 
shrunk O 
is O 
that O 
tour O 
operators O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
no O 
longer O 
aggressively O 
push O 
Palau B-LOC 
as O 
a O 
destination O 
. O 

Hsu B-PER 
notes O 
that O 
Far B-ORG 
East I-ORG 
Airlines I-ORG 
, O 
which O 
operates O 
the O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
- O 
to O 
- O 
Palau B-LOC 
route O 
, O 
raised O 
the O 
price O 
of O 
a O 
ticket O 
by O 
over O 
NT$ O 
3000 O 
two O 
years O 
ago O 
, O 
citing O 
inadequate O 
passenger O 
demand O 
and O 
high O 
costs O 
. O 

This O 
made O 
Palau B-LOC 
much O 
less O 
competitive O 
compared O 
to O 
other O 
places O 
such O 
as O 
Guam B-LOC 
, O 
Bali B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
Phuket B-LOC 
. O 

Hsu B-PER 
concludes O 
: O 
" O 
If O 
the O 
price O 
is O 
raised O 
for O 
tour O 
groups O 
, O 
no O 
one O 
is O 
interested O 
, O 
but O 
if O 
the O 
original O 
price O 
is O 
maintained O 
, O 
the O 
tour O 
operators O 
' O 
profit O 
falls O 
too O 
low O 
. O

Service I-ORG 
, O 
which O 
specializes O 
in O 
Pacific B-LOC

, O 
says O 
that O 
the O 
current O 
trend O 
among O 
travelers O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
is O 
for O 
low O 
group O 
fares O 
with O 
lots O 
of O 
entertainment O 
provided O 
. O 

Though O 
Palau B-LOC 
is O 
rich O 
in O 
natural O 
attractions O 
, O 
it O 
lacks O 
peripheral O 
tourist O 
facilities O 
like O 
pubs O 
, O 
shopping O 
centers O 
, O 
and O 
gift O 
shops O 
, O 
so O 
naturally O 
the O 
islands O 
are O 
less O 
attractive O 
. O 

Despite O 
all O 
this O 
, O 
James B-PER 
Yeh I-PER 
notes O 
that O 
the O 
rate O 
of O 
return O 
visitors O 
to O 
Palau B-LOC 
is O 
very O 
high O 
, O 
more O 
than O 
30 O 
% O 
. O 

If O 
the O 
problems O 
of O 
high O 
group O 
rates O 
and O 
inadequate O 
facilities O 
can O 
be O 
solved O 
, O 
there O 
is O 
enormous O 
potential O 
yet O 
in O 
Palau B-LOC

says O 
that O 
the O

is O 
going O 
forward O 
on O 
a O 
new O 
airport O 
and O 
a O 
number O 
of O

. O 

They O 
are O 
also O 
studying O 
a O 
proposal O 
from O 
the O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
side O 
to O 
lower O 
landing O 
fees O 
and O 
reduce O 
underlying O 
ticket O 
costs O 
. O 

In O 
addition O 
, O 
the O 
PVA B-ORG 
now O 
has O 
a O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
office O 
, O 
and O 
hopes O 
to O 
raise O 
Palau B-LOC 
's O 
profile O 
among O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
travellers O 
. O 

In O 
the O 
current O 
wave O 
of O 
interest O 
in O 
investment O 
in O 
Palau B-LOC 
, O 
the O 
fisheries O 
industry O 
is O 
also O 
getting O 
attention O 
. O 

Currently O 
, O 
there O 
's O 
only O 
one O 
Taiwanese O 
business O 
person O 
in O 
the O 
fishing O 
industry O 
in O 
Palau B-LOC 
- O 
Tai B-PER 
Jung I-PER 
- I-PER 
fei I-PER 
- O 
so O 
profits O 
are O 
quite O 
good O 
. O 

These O 
days O 
, O 
Tai B-PER

Palau B-ORG 
Marine I-ORG

covers O 
an O 
area O 
of O 
1.5 O 
acres O 
and O 
employs O 
more O 
than O 
40 O

. O 

However O 
, O 
though O 
Tai B-PER 
has O 
made O 
quite O 
a O 
name O 
for O 
himself O 
with O 
his O 
business O 
, O 
this O 
does O 
not O 
necessarily O 
mean O 
that O 
other O 
Taiwanese O 
can O 
come O 
and O 
make O 
similar O 
investments O 
. O 

Koo B-PER 
Kuang I-PER

ming I-PER 
, O 
chairman O 
of O 
Koo B-PER

Holdings B-ORG 
Company I-ORG 
Ltd. I-ORG 
, O 
which O 
operates O 
fishing O 
boats O 
in O 
the B-LOC 
South I-LOC 
Pacific I-LOC 
, O 
explains O 
that O 
South B-LOC 
Pacific I-LOC 
fishing O 
is O 
divided O 
into O 
two O 
types O 
- O 
net O 
fishing O 
, O 
and O 
line O 
fishing O 
of O 
tuna O 
. O 

Palau B-LOC 
is O 
not O 
really O 
suited O 
to O 
the O 
former O 
, O 
because O 
its O 
territorial O 
waters O 
are O 
not O 
large O 
, O 
so O 
the O 
catch O 
is O 
limited O 
. O 

On O 
the O 
other O 
hand O 
, O 
tuna O 
stocks O 
there O 
are O 
high O 
, O 
so O 
Palau B-LOC 
is O 
more O 
suited O 
to O 
line O 
fishing O 
. O 

But O 
the O 
problem O 
is O 
that O 
Tai B-PER 
Jung I-PER 
- I-PER 
fei I-PER 
is O 
already O 
running O 
a O 
tuna O 
base O 
there O 
, O 
and O 
it O 
is O 
debatable O 
whether O 
there O 
is O 
the O 
need O 
for O 
another O 
one O 
. O 

Koo B-PER 
warns O 
: O 
" O 
It O 
's O 
hard O 
to O 
estimate O 
the O 
potential O 
catch O 
. O 

In O 
addition O 
, O 
though O 
there O 
are O 
many O 
varieties O 
of O 
fish O 
around O 
Palau B-LOC 
, O 
the O 
scale O 
of O 
operations O 
is O 
small O 
, O 
and O 
markets O 
are O 
far O 
away O 
, O 
so O 
the O 
return O 
on O 
investment O 
would O 
not O 
necessarily O 
be O 
very O 
high O 
. O 

Koo B-PER 
points O 
instead O 
to O 
a O 
different O 
option O 
: O 
The O 
waters O 
around O 
Palau B-LOC 
are O 
clear O 
and O 
warm O 
, O 
which O 
makes O 
them O 
suited O 
to O 
aquaculture O 
. O 

Koo B-PER 
cautions O 
, O 
however O 
, O 
that O 
" O 
if O 
you O 
want O 
to O 
invest O 
, O 
you O 
have O 
to O 
go O 
large O 
- O 
scale O 
, O 
because O 
after O 
all O 
Palau B-LOC 
is O 
far O 
from O 
the O 
main O 
markets O 
. O 
" O 

Palau B-LOC

In O 
1986 O 
, O 
Palau B-LOC 
, O 
like O 
many O 
former O 
American O 
- O

, O 
signed O 
a O 
" O

and O 
there O 
are O 
no O

. O 

For O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
, O 
a O 
major O 
producer O 
of O 
textiles O 
and O 
electronics O 
, O 
this O 
is O 
a O 
very O 
strong O 
investment O 
incentive O 
. O 

Currently O 
Japanese O 
and O 
Taiwanese O 
business O 
people O 
are O 
negotiating O 
with O 
the O 
Palauan O 
government O 
to O 
establish O 
a B-LOC 
Palau I-LOC 
Free I-LOC 
Trade I-LOC 
Zone I-LOC 
. O 

The O 
idea O 
is O 
for O 
Palau B-LOC 
to O 
designate O 
a O 
special O 
zone O 
for O 
economic O 
development O 
, O 
with O 
the O 
Palau B-LOC 
government O 
providing O 
tax O 
and O 
land O 
- O 
use O 
incentives O 
. O 

The O 
zone O 
would O 
be O 
for O 
processing O 
of O 
exports O 
, O 
mainly O 
in O 
textiles O 
and O 
electronics O 
, O 
and O 
mainly O

very O 
familiar O

But O 
even O 
leasing O 
is O 
a O 
complicated O 
matter O

The O

the O 
post-presidential-election O 
situation O 
, O 
combined O 
with O 
pressure O 
from O 
public O 
opinion O 
, O 
pushed O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
to O 
work O 
with O 
the O 
DPP B-ORG 
on O 
means O 
to O 
phase O 
out O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
, O 
despite O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
's O 
previous O 
opposition O 
to O 
the O 
body O 
's O 
complete O 
dissolution O 
in O 
the O 
name O 
of O 
preserving O 
the O 
constitutional O 
structure O 
. O 

For O 
a O 
time O 
, O 
the O 
question O 
of O 
whether O 
to O 
hold O 
elections O 
for O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
, O 
as O 
well O 
as O 
the O 
DPP B-ORG 
and O 
KMT B-ORG 
's O 
shared O 
policy O 
for O 
phasing O 
out O 
the O 
body O 
, O 
were O 
viewed O 
as O 
motivated O 
by O 
fear O 
of O 
the O 
growth O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
People I-ORG 
First I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
-LRB- O 
PFP B-ORG 
-RRB- O 
. O 

Thus O 
the O 
hubbub O 
continued O 
over O 
the O 
fate O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
for O 
a O 
fortnight O 
, O 
until O 
finally O 
the O 
newly O 
formed O 
PFP B-ORG 
caucus O 
in O 
the O 
assembly O 
agreed O 
to O 
its O 
gradual O 
downsizing O 
. O 

This O 
paved O 
the O 
way O 
for O 
the O 
commencement O 
on O 
April O 
8 O 
of O 
the O 
sixth O 
round O 
of O 
constitutional O 
revisions O 
in O 
recent O 
years O 
, O 
in O 
which O 
such O 
issues O 
as O 
reducing O 
the O 
total O 
number O 
of O 
NA B-ORG 
delegates O 
and O 
freezing O 
their O 
powers O 
and O 
duties O 
- O 
amounting O 
to O 
their O 
" O 
self O 
- O 
abolition O 
" O 
- O 
became O 
the O 
center O 
of O 
discussion O 
. O 

The O 
various O 
parties O 
leveraged O 
their O 
carrots O 
and O 
sticks O 
against O 
their O 
delegates O 
, O 
threatening O 
expulsion O 
for O 
not O 
supporting O 
the O 
neutralization O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
at O 
the O 
same O 
time O 
as O 
they O 
tried O 
to O 
appease O 
their O 
delegates O 
. O 

Finally O 
, O 
on O 
April O 
24 O 
these O 
maneuvers O 
helped O 
bring O 
about O 
the O 
passage O 
of O 
several O 
constitutional O 
revisions O 
, O 
including O 
deactivation O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
, O 
favorable O 
provisions O 
for O 
residents O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
offshore O 
islands O 
-LRB- O 
Kinmen B-LOC 
, O 
Matsu B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
Penghu B-LOC 
-RRB- O 
and O 
military O 
personnel O 
, O 
and O 
revocation O 
of O 
lifelong O 
special O 
privileges O 
for O 
grand O 
justices O 
. O 

In O 
line O 
with O 
these O 
revisions O 
, O 
the O 
voting O 
public O 
will O 
no O 
longer O 
directly O 
elect O 
NA B-ORG 
delegates O 
. O 

Rather O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
will O 
become O 
a O 
" O 
task O 
- O 
based O 
body O 
" O 
generated O 
according O 
to O 
proportional O 
political O 
party O 
representation O 
in O 
the O 
legislature O 
, O 
maintaining O 
the O 
rights O 
to O 
ratification O 
of O 
constitutional O 
revisions O 
proposed O 
by O 
the B-ORG 
Legislative I-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
, O 
impeachment O 
of O 
the O 
president O 
and O 
vice O 
president O 
, O 
and O 
resolutions O 
on O 
modifications O 
to O 
national O 
territory O 
. O 

With O 
these O 
changes O 
, O 
legislators O 
will O 
exercise O 
approval O 
over O 
personnel O 
appointments O 
to O 
the O 
Judicial B-ORG 
, O 
Examination B-ORG 
and O 
Control B-ORG 
yuans I-ORG 
. O 

To O 
be O 
fair O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
does O 
have O 
its O 
unique O 
set O 
of O 
duties O 
and O 
powers O 
under O 
the O 
existing O 
structure O 
, O 
thus O 
few O 
people O 
are O 
ready O 
to O 
call O 
for O 
its O 
complete O 
abolition O 
. O 

This O 
is O 
especially O 
notable O 
given O 
the O 
ambiguity O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
constitutional O 
structure O 
, O 
seeing O 
as O 
it O 
is O 
not O 
a O 
presidential O 
system O 
, O 
a O 
cabinet O 
system O 
, O 
or O 
a O 
two O 
- O 
headed O 
system O 
in O 
the O 
true O 
sense O 
. O 

Many O 
scholars O 
caution O 
that O 
eliminating O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
and O 
handing O 
all O 
its O 
powers O 
to O 
the B-ORG 
Legislative I-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
, O 
while O 
the O 
government O 
structure O 
remains O 
ambiguous O 
, O 
is O 
not O 
the O 
best O 
structural O 
framework O 
. O 

That O 
said O 
, O 
despite O 
landmark O 
changes O 
such O 
as O 
the O 
full O 
election O 
of O 
the O 
national O 
parliament O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
and O 
establishment O 
of O 
the O 
legal O 
groundwork O 
for O 
the O 
direct O 
election O 
of O 
the O 
ROC B-LOC 
president O 
, O 
the O 
ROC O 
Constitution O 
has O 
been O 
revamped O 
with O 
alarming O 
frequency O 
over O 
the O 
past O 
few O 
years O 
. O 

Further O 
, O 
new O 
duties O 
and O 
authorities O 
were O 
given O 
to O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
in O 
order O 
to O 
achieve O 
successive O 
constitutional O 
revisions O 
. O 

For O 
instance O 
, O 
in O 
exchange O 
for O 
the O 
assembly O 
agreeing O 
to O 
give O 
up O 
its O 
authority O 
to O 
elect O 
the O 
president O 
, O 
the O 
body O 
was O 
given O 
power O 
of O 
approval O 
over O 
personnel O 
appointments O 
to O 
the O 
Judicial B-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
, O 
Examination B-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
, O 
and O 
Control B-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
. O 

With O 
each O 
revision O 
, O 
the O 
constitution O 
became O 
increasingly O 
jumbled O 
, O 
while O 
NA B-ORG 
delegates O 
leveraged O 
their O 
positions O 
to O 
exact O 
" O 
constitutional O 
amendment O 
rent O 
" O 
and O 
fatten O 
themselves O 
up O 
. O 

Last O 
year O 
's O 
term O 
extension O 
bill O 
further O 
solidified O 
the O 
public O 
's O 
image O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
as O 
no O 
more O 
than O 
a O 
tool O 
of O 
political O 
struggle O 
, O 
and O 
a O 
self O 
- O 
indulgent O 
body O 
at O 
that O 
, O 
generating O 
widespread O 
consensus O 
on O 
the O 
necessity O 
of O 
dissolving O 
it O 
. O 

While O 
the O 
latest O 
round O 
of O 
constitutional O 
revisions O 
satisfies O 
the O 
general O 
desire O 
across O 
the O 
political O 
spectrum O 
to O 
progressively O 
dismantle O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
, O 
sloppy O 
accompanying O 
provisions O 
and O 
the O 
failure O 
of O 
the O 
various O 
political O 
parties O 
to O 
propose O 
a O 
new O 
blueprint O 
in O 
its O 
place O 
provide O 
cause O 
for O 
new O 
concern O 
over O 
the O 
health O 
of O 
constitutional O 
government O 
in O 
the O 
ROC B-LOC 
. O 

For O 
example O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
will O 
become O 
a O 
" O 
task O 
- O 
based O 
body O 
" O 
generated O 
according O 
to O 
the O 
proportion O 
of O 
seats O 
held O 
by O 
each O 
political O 
party O 
in O 
the O 
legislature O 
. O 

National B-ORG 
Taiwan I-ORG 
University I-ORG 
professor O 
Lee B-PER 
Hung I-PER 
- I-PER 
hsi I-PER 
, O 
an O 
expert O 
on O 
constitutional O 
law O 
, O 
points O 
out O 
that O 
less O 
than O 
10 O 
% O 
of O 
the O 
Taiwanese O 
population O 
takes O 
part O 
in O 
political O 
party O 
activities O 
. O 

Thus O 
a B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
generated O 
proportionally O 
according O 
to O 
party O 
representation O 
represents O 
suppression O 
of O 
the O 
views O 
of O 
the O 
other O 
90 O 
% O 
of O 
the O 
population O 
, O 
and O 
thus O 
violates O 
the O 
principle O 
of O 
vesting O 
authority O 
over O 
constitutional O 
government O 
in O 
the O 
people O 
. O 

Following O 
the O 
demobilization O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
, O 
many O 
functions O 
and O 
powers O 
currently O 
held O 
by O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
will O 
be O 
transferred O 
to O 
the B-ORG 
Legislative I-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
. O 

This O 
in O 
turn O 
raises O 
fears O 
in O 
the O 
academic O 
community O 
that O 
the B-ORG 
Legislative I-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
could O 
become O 
an O 
untamable O 
new O 
constitutional O 
monster O 
. O 

The O 
expanded O 
powers O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Legislative I-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
also O 
include O 
the O 
impeachment O 
and O 
recall O 
of O 
the O 
president O 
and O 
vice O 
president O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
supplementary O 
election O 
of O 
the O 
vice O 
president O 
. O 

These O 
changes O 
tighten O 
the O 
relationship O 
between O 
the O 
parliament O 
and O 
the O 
president O 
, O 
requiring O 
the O 
president O 
to O 
report O 
to O 
the B-ORG 
Legislative I-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
on O 
the O 
state O 
of O 
the O 
nation O 
. O 

A O 
China B-ORG 
Times I-ORG 
editorial O 
urged O 
that O 
the O 
question O 
of O 
whether O 
the O 
enormous O 
Legislative B-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
might O 
be O 
split O 
into O 
two O 
houses O 
by O 
function O 
be O 
evaluated O 
and O 
worked O 
out O 
as O 
soon O 
as O 
possible O 
. O 

The O 
legal O 
demobilization O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
was O 
conducted O 
without O 
a O 
hitch O 
, O 
yet O 
the O 
future O 
of O 
constitutional O 
government O 
looks O 
bleak O 
. O 

This O 
dire O 
outlook O 
is O 
surely O 
not O 
something O 
Taiwan B-LOC

political O 
parties O 
expected O 
when O

In O

over O

not O

My O

When O 
my O 
wife O 
's O 
company O 
sent O 
her O 
to O 
Paris B-LOC 
to O 
work O 
, O 
we O 
did O 
n't O 
think O 
that O 
our O 
daughter O 
, O 
then O 
just O 
over O 
a O 
year O 
old O 
, O 
would O 
have O 
any O 
problems O 
with O 
attending O 
school O 
there O 
. O 

What O 
could O 
we O 
do O 
with O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
if O 
she O 
was O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
viewed O 
as O 
a O 
" O 
little O 
foreigner O 
" O 
and O 
be O 
bullied O 
at O 
school O 
every O 
day O 
? O 

And O 
so O 
we O 
hired O 
Martine B-PER 
, O 
a O 
Frenchwoman O 
in O 
her O 
50s O 
, O 
to O 
be O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
's I-PER 
nanny O 
. O 

My O 
wife O 
truly O 
treasures O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
, O 
and O 
was O 
not O 
at O 
all O 
comfortable O 
with O 
the O 
idea O 
of O 
leaving O 
her O 
with O 
someone O 
else O 
. O 

First O 
, O 
we O 
had O 
no O 
idea O 
what O 
kind O 
of O 
person O 
Martine B-PER 
was O 
. O 

We O 
knew O 
only O 
that O 
she O 
was O 
a O 
licensed O 
nanny O 
with O 
documents O 
from O 
the O 
French O 
government O 
, O 
and O 
hiring O 
her O 
to O 
look O 
after O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
seemed O 
better O 
than O 
hiring O 
a O 
cheaper O 
unlicensed O 
nanny O 
. O 

Second O 
, O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
understood O 
no O 
French O 
, O 
so O 
we O 
were O 
concerned O 
that O 
she O 
might O 
be O 
mistreated O 
. O 

We O 
could O 
n't O 
have O 
guessed O 
that O 
Martine B-PER 
would O 
treasure O 
her O 
just O 
as O 
much O 
as O 
my O 
wife O 
does O 
. O 

And O 
Martine B-PER 
knew O 
how O 
to O 
handle O 
children O 
! O 

I O 
remember O 
the O 
first O 
day O 
we O 
took O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
to O 
Martine B-PER 
's O 
place O 
. O 

My O 
wife O 
and O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
played O 
out O 
an O 
extended O 
farewell O 
scene O 
before O 
finally O 
tearfully O 
parting O 
. O 

Although O 
I O 
understood O 
no O 
French O 
in O 
those O 
days O 
, O 
I O 
was O 
prepared O 
to O 
spend O 
the O 
whole O 
day O 
with O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
. O 

I O 
wanted O 
to O 
convey O 
to O 
Martine B-PER 
the O 
idea O 
that O 
" O 
if O 
you O 
beat O 
the O 
dog O 
, O 
you O 
'd O 
better O 
be O 
prepared O 
to O 
deal O 
with O 
the O 
master O 
. O 
" O 

But O 
in O 
spite O 
of O 
my O 
resolution O 
, O 
within O 
ten O 
minutes O 
, O 
with O 
Martine B-PER 
gesturing O 
and O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
sobbing O 
, O 
I O 
was O 
hustled O 
out O 
the O 
door O 
. O 

Later O 
Martine B-PER 
told O 
my O 
wife O 
that O 
I O 
had O 
had O 
to O 
leave O 
unless O 
I O 
wanted O 
to O 
spend O 
my O 
entire O 
life O 
holding O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
's I-PER 
hand O 
. O 

It O 
took O 
Martine B-PER 
to O 
remind O 
us O 
that O 
short O 
, O 
sharp O 
pains O 
are O 
better O 
than O 
long O 
, O 
drawn O 
- O 
out O 
suffering O 
. O 

At O 
the O 
outset O 
, O 
we O 
were O 
concerned O 
that O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
would O 
n't O 
like O 
French O 
food O 
, O 
so O 
we O 
prepared O 
a O 
lunchbox O 
for O 
her O 
everyday O 
and O 
delivered O 
it O 
with O 
her O 
to O 
Martine B-PER 
. O 

Thinking O 
, O 
" O 
If O 
this O 
continues O 
, O 
she O 
'll O 
starve O 
to O 
death O 
, O 
" O 
we O 
confronted O 
Martine B-PER 
. O 

Confronted O 
, O 
Martine B-PER 
calmly O 
informed O 
us O 
that O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
could O 
n't O 
spend O 
her O 
entire O 
time O 
in O 
France B-LOC 
eating O 
the O 
lunchboxes O 
we O 
prepared O 
. O 

And O 
, O 
she O 
continued O 
, O 
since O 
that O 
was O 
the O 
case O 
, O 
why O 
not O 
get O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
used O 
to O 
eating O 
French O 
food O 
as O 
soon O 
as O 
possible O 
? O 

Furthermore O 
, O 
she O 
informed O 
us O 
that O 
her O 
own O 
nutritious O 
homemade O 
meals O 
would O 
help O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
grow O 
. O 

She O 
was O 
even O 
planning O 
to O 
prepare O 
a O 
" O 
dinner O 
box O 
" O 
for O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
to O 
bring O 
home O 
in O 
the O 
evenings O 
. O 

One O 
day O 
, O 
Martine B-PER 
mentioned O 
to O 
us O 
that O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
was O 
a O 
little O 
cross-eyed O 
. O 

To O 
ease O 
our O 
minds O 
, O 
she O 
had O 
already O 
taken O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
to O 
see O 
her O 
uncle O 
, O 
an O 
ophthalmologist O 
. O 

If O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
would O 
visit O 
him O 
again O 
four O 
or O 
five O 
times O 
at O 
two O 
- O 
week O 
intervals O 
, O 
everything O 
would O 
be O 
fine O 
. O 

But O 
Martine B-PER 
was O 
different O 
. O 

When O 
the O 
weather O 
turned O 
cool O 
and O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
came O 
down O 
with O 
a O 
fever O 
, O 
Martine B-PER 
called O 
my O 
wife O 
to O 
offer O 
to O 
keep O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
for O 
the O 
night O 
. O 

She O 
told O 
my O 
wife O 
that O 
she O 
had O 
been O 
a O 
nurse O 
and O 
that O 
taking O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
home O 
in O 
the O 
cold O 
night O 
air O 
might O 
worsen O 
her O 
chill O 
. O 

In O 
this O 
way O 
, O 
we O 
became O 
more O 
and O 
more O 
comfortable O 
-LRB- O 
and O 
more O 
and O 
more O 
grateful O 
-RRB- O 
having O 
Martine B-PER 
as O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
's I-PER 
nanny O 
. O 

I O 
think O 
Martine B-PER 
treated O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
just O 
as O 
if O 
she O 
were O 
her O 
own O 
child O 
. O 

Chien B-PER

told O 
my O 
wife O 
that O 
Chien B-PER 
- I-PER 
chien I-PER 
's I-PER 
French O 
is O 
very O 
good O 
. O 

Perhaps O 
because O 
our O 
little O 
" O 
foreigner O 
" O 
now O 
speaks O 
French O 
, O 
she O 
gets O 
along O 
very O 
well O 
with O 
her O

; O 
they O 
all O 
remember O 
her O 
French O

Elodie B-PER

and O 
let O 
her O 
know O 
that O 
I O

there O 
when O 
they O 
see O 
me O 
coming O 
to O

her O 
up O 
after O

We O 
owe O 
all O 
of O

a O 
cautionary O 
note O 
: O 
" O 
I O 
do O

the O

" O 

Chien B-PER 
points O 
out O 
that O 
school O 
textbooks O 
only O 
teach O 
moral O 
lessons O 
like O 
" O 
a O 
penny O 
saved O 
is O 
a O 
penny O 
earned O 
, O 
" O 
which O 
are O 
not O 
exactly O 
what O 
the O 
real O

demands O 
these O

. O 

Chien B-PER 
says O 
that O 
the O 
situation O 
is O 
just O 
like O

in O 
the O

According O 
to O 
statistics O

many O 
years O 
, O 
and O 
offers O 
the O 
following O 
thoughts O 
about O 
trends O 
in O 
money O 
management O 
. O 

Chia B-PER 
recalls O 
that O 
in O 
the O 
1960s O 
, O 
people O 
were O 
too O 
poor O 
to O 
have O 
any O 
money O 
to O 
manage O 
; O 
there O 
were O 
also O 
fears O 
of O 
war O 
, O 
and O 
so O 
any O 
money O 
people O 
did O 
have O 
they O 
quickly O 
exchanged O 
for O 
gold O 
or O 
US B-LOC 
dollars O 
on O 
the O 
black O 
market O 
. O 

The O 
real O 
fad O 
for O 
personal O 
money O 
management O 
only O 
hit O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
in O 
the O 
mid-1980s O 
. O 

The O 
huge O 
trade O 
surplus O 
built O 
up O 
over O 
many O 
years O 
caused O 
the O 
NT O 
dollar O 
to O 
appreciate O 
, O 
and O 
attracted O 
a O 
huge O 
amount O 
of O 
speculative O 
foreign O 
money O 
into O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
. O 

But O 
, O 
having O 
reviewed O 
the O 
past O 
, O 
Chia B-PER 
Chen I-PER 
- I-PER 
i I-PER 
declares O 
: O 
" O 
In O 
money O 
management O 
, O 
you O 
can O 
only O 
look O 
to O 
the O 
future O 
; O 
there O 
's O 
no O 
point O 
in O 
regretting O 
what O 
's O 
gone O 
. O 
" O 

Take O 
for O 
example O 
the O 
case O 
of O 
Mrs. O 
Chang B-PER 
. O 

At O 
the O 
time O 
, O 
the O 
price O 
of O 
high O 
- O 
rise O 
apartments O 
in O 
the B-LOC 
Tanshui I-LOC

fallen O 
from O 
NT$ O 
220,000 O 
per O 
ping O 
to O 
NT$ O 
150,000 O 
. O 

Congratulating O 
herself O 
on O 
getting O 
a O 
low O 
price O 
, O 
and O 
confident O 
that O 
the O 
market O 
would O 
rebound O 
, O 
Mrs. O 
Chang B-PER 
happily O 
put O 
down O 
the O 
first O 
payment O 
and O 
watched O 
her O 
brother O 
's O 
family O 
move O 
in O 
. O 

Today O 
you O 
can O 
find O 
high O

rise O 
apartments O 
in O 
Tanshui B-LOC 
New I-LOC 
Town I-LOC 
for O 
as O 
little O 
as O 
NT$ O 
110,000 O 
per O 
ping O 
. O 

Mrs. O 
Chang B-PER 
's O 
brother O 
's O 
family O 
is O 
stuck O 
with O 
a O 
heavy O 
mortgage O 
, O 
and O 
there O 
are O 
constant O 
recriminations O 
between O 
Mrs. O 
Chang B-PER 
and O 
her O 
nieces O 
and O 
nephews. O 

Will O 
the O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
property O 
market O 
inevitably O 
recover O 
? O 

Looking O 
around O 
the O

at O 
the O

Japan B-LOC 
, O 
Hong B-LOC

and O 
even O

there O 
are O 
countless O 
examples O 
of O 
long O 
- O

downturns O 
in O 
the O

. O 

The O 
popular O 
book O

notes O 
that O 
the O 
sharp O 
rise O 
in O 
housing O 
prices O 
in O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
in O 
the O 
1960s O 
and O 
1970s O 
was O 
due O 
to O 
underlying O 
structural O 
factors O 
: O 

The O 
upshot O 
of O 
all O

According O 
to O 
Liu B-PER 
, O 
individualism O

the O

have O 
broken O 
down O 
the O

In O

since O

" O 
If O

In O 
the O

30 O

As O 
is O

Taiwan B-LOC

enemy O 
to O

In O

the O

that O 
in O 
looking O 
at O 
the O 
diplomatic O 
struggle O 
between O 
the O 
ROC B-LOC

PRC B-LOC 
, O 
it O 
is O 
useful O 
to O 
distinguish O 
three O 
arenas O 
: O 
the O 
Asia B-LOC

Pacific I-LOC 
situation O 
, O 
formal O 
diplomatic O

Since O 
the O

took O 
office O

the O 
PRC B-LOC

been O 
deeply O 
worried O 
by O 
the O 
party O

advocacy O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
independence O 
. O 

As O 
a O 
result O 
, O 
the O 
two O 
sides O 
have O 
yet O 
to O 
open O 
any O 
formal O 
dialogue O 
mechanism O 
such O 
as O 
existed O 
before O 
the O 
freezing O 
of O

occurred O 
after O

to O 
the O

position O 
in O 
the O 
US B-LOC

PRC B-LOC

An O

of O

up O

At O 
the O

possible O 
, O 
the O 
PRC B-LOC 
has O 
brought O 
its O 
diplomatic O 
superiority O 
to O 
bear O 
in O 
order O 
to O 
ensure O 
that O 
it O 
will O

chairman O 
of O 
Research B-ORG 
and I-ORG 
Planning I-ORG 
Board I-ORG 
at O 
the O 
MOFA B-ORG 
, O 
believes O 
that O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
still O 
has O 
room O 
to O 
maneuver O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
international O 
economic O 
organizations O 
. O 

But O 
as O 
for O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
and O 
its O 
affiliated O 
organizations O 
, O 
such O 
as O 
the B-ORG 
World I-ORG 
Health I-ORG 
Organization I-ORG 
or O 
UNESCO B-ORG 
, O 
the O 
ROC B-LOC 
faces O 
countless O 
obstacles O 
. O 

In O 
fact O 
, O 
the O 
ROC B-LOC 
is O 
currently O 
the O 
only O 
nation O 
that O 
enjoys O 
sovereignty O 
that O 
is O 
excluded O 
from O 
United B-ORG

. O 

When O 
Chen B-PER 
Shui I-PER 
- I-PER 
bian I-PER 
visited O 
Costa B-LOC 
Rica I-LOC 
in O 
August O 
, O 
the O 
president O 
of O 
that O 
country O 
, O 
Miguel B-PER 
Angel I-PER 
Rodriguez I-PER 
, O 
indicated O 
for O 
the O 
first O 
time O 
that O 
his O 
country O 
would O 
be O 
willing O 
to O 
help O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
enter O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
. O 

In O 
fact O 
, O 
this O 
has O 
already O 
happened O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
public O 
, O 
which O 
has O 
seen O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
effort O 
fail O 
repeatedly O 
. O 

People O 
are O 
wondering O 
whether O 
something O 
should O 
be O 
changed O 
in O 
the O 
ROC B-LOC 
approach O 
to O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
. O 

Lo B-PER

says O 
that O 
you O 
can O 
not O 
only O 
look O 
at O 
the O 
results O 
of O 
efforts O 
to O 
enter O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
- O 
you O 
also O 
have O 
to O 
look O 
at O 
the O 
significance O 
of O 
the O 
process O 
. O 

" O 
Applying O 
for O 
entry O 
to O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
demonstrates O 
that O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
is O 
a O 
sovereign O 
state O 
and O 
is O 
qualified O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
UN B-ORG 
member O 
. O 

In O 
addition O 
, O 
from O 
the O 
perspective O 
of O 
the O 
foreign O 
ministry O 
, O 
efforts O 
to O 
re-enter O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
are O 
not O 
only O 
excellent O 
training O 
for O 
diplomatic O 
personnel O 
, O 
but O 
also O 
provide O 
a O 
regular O 
test O 
of O 
how O 
secure O

are O 
between O 
the O 
ROC B-LOC

its O 
diplomatic O 
partner O

, O 
" O 
explains O 
Lo B-PER 
. O 

The O 
PRC B-LOC 
worked O 
for O 
21 O 
years O 
to O 
gain O 
entry O 
to O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
, O 
while O 
we O 
have O 
only O 
been O 
at O 
it O 
a O 
few O 
years O 
. O 

This O 
year O 
the O 
ROC B-LOC 
application O 
to O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
particularly O 
emphasized O 
that O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
could O 
serve O 
as O 
a O 
forum O 
for O 
the O 
peaceful O 
resolution O 
of O 
the O 
cross-strait O

Joanne B-PER

says O 
that O 
although O 
most O

that O

strategies O 
- O 
" O

of O

, O 
" O 
economic O 
diplomacy O 
, O 
and O 
entry O 
into O 
nongovernmental O 
organizations O 
- O 
differ O 
little O 
from O 
the O 
past O 
, O 
you O 
must O 
remember O 
that O 
diplomacy O 
is O 
a O 
long O 
- O 
term O 
game O 
, O 
and O 
, O 
in O 
the O 
details O 
, O 
the O 
new O 
foreign O 
policy O 
team O 
has O 
already O 
brought O 
in O 
some O 
fresh O 
air O 
. O 

For O 
example O 
, O 
she O 
notes O 
, O 
recently O 
the O 
MOFA B-ORG 
, O 
through O 
its O 
" O 
virtual O 
diplomacy O 
institute O 
, O 
" O 
has O 
begun O 
offering O 
a O 
class O 
in O 
" O 
diplomacy O 
of O 
the O 
whole O 
people O 
" O 
that O 
provides O 
training O 
to O

assistants O 
, O

and O 
employees O

Lo B-PER

relates O 
that O 
, O 
though O 
there O 
is O 
no O 
direct O 
and O 
immediate O 
impact O 
on O 
inter-state O 
relations O 
as O 
a O 
result O 
of O 
private O 
participation O 
in O 
nongovernmental O 
organizations O 
, O 
nevertheless O 
such O 
participation O 
can O 
strengthen O 
communication O 
and O 
contact O 
between O 
peoples O 
. O 

The B-ORG 
Research I-ORG 
and I-ORG 
Planning I-ORG 
Board I-ORG 
intends O 
to O 
establish O 
a O 
special O 
NGO O 
subcommittee O 
, O 
led O 
by O 
the O 
government O 
, O 
to O 
provide O 
information O 
and O 
practical O 
assistance O 
to O 
domestic O 
NGOs O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
. O 

Lo B-PER 
explains O 
that O 
in O 
democratic O 
countries O 
, O 
with O 
whom O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
would O 
like O 
to O 
strengthen O 
ties O 
, O 
public O 
opinion O 
is O 
the O 
source O 
of O 
policy O 
direction O 
. O 

Besides O 
promoting O 
new O 
ideas O 
, O 
says O 
Lo B-PER 
, O 
the O 
MOFA B-ORG 
is O 
also O 
undertaking O 
internal O 
reform O 
. O 

In O 
early O 
September O 
the O 
MOFA B-ORG 
announced O 
that O 
, O 
based O 
on O 
efficiency O 
evaluations O 
, O 
the O 
government O 
would O 
close O 
its O 
representative O 
offices O 
in O 
the O 
African O 
countries O 
of O 
the O 
Congo B-LOC 
, O 
Angola B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
Madagascar B-LOC 
. O 

As O 
Lo B-PER 
says O 
, O 
" O 
The O 
ROC B-LOC 
must O 
move O 
in O 
the O 
direction O 
of O 
flexible O 
diplomacy O 
and O 
utilize O 
foreign O 
policy O 
resources O 
more O 
flexibly O 
. O 
" O 

Lo B-PER 
says O 
that O 
the O 
main O 
countries O 
that O 
will O 
be O 
at O 
the O 
center O 
of O 
future O 
diplomatic O 
work O 
, O 
besides O 
the O 
ROC B-LOC 
's O 
existing O 
diplomatic O 
partners O 
, O 
will O 
be O 
the O 
nations O 
of O 
North B-LOC 
America I-LOC 
and O 
Europe B-LOC 
. O 

Though O 
in O 
office O 
for O 
less O 
than O 
four O 
months O 
, O 
foreign O 
minister O 
Tien B-PER 
Hung I-PER 
- I-PER 
mao I-PER 
has O 
already O 
been O 
to O 
Europe B-LOC 
twice O 
. O 

Following O 
closely O 
on O 
President O 
Chen B-PER 
's O 
trip O 
, O 
in O 
late O 
September O 
Vice O 
President O 
Annette B-PER 
Lu I-PER 
traveled O 
to O 
Central O 
American O 
countries O 
that O 
President O 
Chen B-PER 
could O 
not O 
fit O 
into O 
his O 
itinerary O 
, O 
including O 
El B-LOC 
Salvador I-LOC 
, O 
Honduras B-LOC 
, O 
Belize B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
Guatemala B-LOC 
, O 
all O 
of O 
which O 
have O 
formal O 
diplomatic O 
ties O 
with O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
. O 

In O 
contrast O 
to O 
the O 
male O 
way O 
of O 
thinking O 
, O 
in O 
which O 
priority O 
has O 
always O 
been O 
given O 
to O 
considerations O 
of O 
political O 
and O 
economic O 
power O 
, O 
Annette B-PER 
Lu I-PER 
has O 
emphasized O 
" O 
soft O 
national O 
power O 
. O 
" O 

If O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
can O 
further O 
develop O 
foreign O 
relations O 
using O 
such O 
" O 
soft O 
power O 
, O 
" O 
one O 
day O 
the B-ORG 
United I-ORG 
Nations I-ORG 
will O 
turn O 
around O 
and O 
want O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
to O 
join O 
. O 

Before O 
departing O 
on O 
his O 
trip O 
, O 
President O 
Chen B-PER 
repeatedly O 
stressed O 
that O 
, O 
despite O 
the O 
tremendous O 
pressure O 
coming O 
from O 
the O 
mainland O 
, O 
there O 
are O 
other O 
considerations O 
in O 
foreign O 
policy O 
. O 

Indeed O 
, O 
says O 
Joanne B-PER 
Chang I-PER 
, O 
it O 
is O 
precisely O 
because O 
diplomatic O 
and O 
cross-strait O 
issues O 
are O 
inextricably O 
intertwined O 
that O 
foreign O 
policy O 
breakthroughs O 
are O 
needed O 
. O

After O

gained O

of O 
the O

, O 
in O 
view O 
of O

long O 
overseas O 
experience O 
of O 
diplomatic O

and O 
the O 
overseas O

In O

of O 
the B-ORG

She O 
became O 
the O 
first O 
serving O 
MOFA B-ORG 
official O 
to O 
enter O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
headquarters O 
building O 
since O 
the O 
ROC B-LOC 
left O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
. O 

When O 
news O 
of O 
this O 
got O 
out O 
, O 
the O 
PRC B-LOC 
delegation O 
at O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
immediately O 
pro-tested O 
, O 
and O 
demanded O 
that O 
the O 
two O 
should O 
leave O 
the O 
conference O 
chamber O 
and O 
be O 
excluded O 
from O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
building O 
. O 

The O 
next O 
day O 
, O 
showing O 
commendable O 
courage O 
, O 
Yang B-PER 
and O 
Peng B-PER 
slipped O 
back O 
into O 
the O 
conference O 
chamber O 
. O 

But O 
their O 
actions O 
also O 
attracted O 
the O 
criticism O 
that O 
this O 
kind O 
of O 
high O 
- O 
decibel O 
display O 
is O 
not O 
in O 
fact O 
helpful O 
for O 
achieving O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
return O 
to O 
the B-ORG 
United I-ORG 
Nations I-ORG 
. O 

However O 
, O 
Yang B-PER 
does O 
not O 
subscribe O 
to O 
this O 
view O 
. O 

Enthusiastic O 
, O 
outspoken O 
and O 
full O 
of O 
vitality O 
, O 
she O 
is O 
highly O 
optimistic O 
about O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
prospects O 
for O 
participation O 
in O 
UN B-ORG 
- O 
associated O 
NGOs O 
, O 
and O 
believes O 
that O 
as O 
temples O 
of O 
popular O 
campaigning O 
, O 
NGOs O 
can O 
develop O 
the O 
strength O 
of O 
the O 
Taiwanese O 
people O 
. O 

After O 
the O 
new O 
government O 
took O 
office O 
, O 
apart O 
from O 
being O 
briefed O 
on O 
our O 
diplomatic O 
partners O 
and O 
on O 
countries O 
with O 
which O 
we O 
do O 
n't O 
have O 
diplomatic O 
relations O 
, O 
I O 
also O 
looked O 
at O 
civic O 
organizations O 
with O 
which O 
the O 
MOFA B-ORG 
has O 
contacts O 
and O 
which O 
are O 
frequently O 
active O 
in O 
the O 
international O 
community O 
. O 

I O 
discovered O 
that O 
the B-ORG 
World I-ORG 
League I-ORG 
for I-ORG 
Freedom I-ORG 
and I-ORG 
Democracy I-ORG 
is O 
a O 
well O 
- O 
run O 
international O 
organization O 
with O 
a O 
complete O 
organizational O 
structure O 
, O 
is O 
a O 
member O 
of O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
's O 
Department B-ORG 
of I-ORG 
Public I-ORG 
Information I-ORG 
, O 
and O 
attends O 
the O 
Annual O 
DPI O 
/ O 
NGO O 
Conference O 
every O 
year O 
. O 

Therefore O 
when O 
Professor O 
Peng B-PER 
invited O 
me O 
to O 
attend O 
, O 
I O 
agreed O 
to O 
join O 
the O 
delegation O 
as O 
an O 
advisor O 
to O 
the O 
league O 
. O 

The O 
MOFA B-ORG 
was O 
very O 
excited O 
about O 
my O 
attending O 
the O 
conference O 
, O 
because O 
we O 
can O 
say O 
that O 
this O 
is O 
the O 
first O 
time O 
a O 
MOFA B-ORG 
official O 
has O 
entered O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
headquarters O 
building O 
in O 
the O 
last O 
30 O 
years O 
. O 

Another O 
main O 
focus O 
of O 
discussion O 
was O 
the O 
partnership O 
between O 
NGOs O 
, O 
national O 
governments O 
and O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
itself O 
. O 

The O 
UN B-ORG 
itself O 
is O 
an O 
organization O 
of O 
national O 
governments O 
. O 

Those O 
attending O 
included O 
the O 
great O 
American O 
entrepreneur O 
George B-PER 
Soros I-PER 
, O 
who O 
funded O 
the O 
forum O 
, O 
the O 
former O 
US B-LOC 
ambassador O 
to O 
Beijing B-LOC 
, O 
Winston B-PER 
Lord I-PER 
, O 
and O 
so O 
on O 
- O 
all O 
high O 
- O 
ranking O 
, O 
highly O 
influential O 
people O 
. O 

At O 
present O 
, O 
apart O 
from O 
the B-ORG 
World I-ORG 
League I-ORG 
for I-ORG 
Freedom I-ORG 
and I-ORG 
Democracy I-ORG 
, O 
a O 
number O 
of O 
other O 
NGOs O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
are O 
associated O 
with O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
, O 
including O 
women O 
's O 
, O 
aboriginal O 
and O 
academic O 
groups O 
. O 

We O 
hope O 
that O 
in O 
the O 
future O 
more O 
groups O 
will O 
actively O 
develop O 
an O 
international O 
profile O 
, O 
and O 
apply O 
to O 
register O 
with O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
. O 

Another O 
way O 
people O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
can O 
actively O 
participate O 
in O 
international O 
affairs O 
is O 
by O 
encouraging O 
people O 
of O 
ability O 
and O 
influence O 
in O 
society O 
to O 
apply O 
to O 
join O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
's O 
own O 
NGOs O 
, O 
such O 
as O 
population O 
, O 
human O 
rights O 
, O 
peace O 
and O 
environmental O 
groups O 
, O 
so O 
that O 
they O 
can O 
contribute O 
their O 
knowledge O 
, O 
and O 
at O 
the O 
same O 
time O 
let O 
others O 
better O 
understand O 
people O 
from O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
. O 

We O 
are O 
living O 
in O 
an O 
age O 
of O 
people O 
power O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
is O 
responding O 
to O 
the O 
trends O 
of O 
our O 
time O 
. O 

In O 
the O 
past O 
, O 
NGOs O 
merely O 
played O 
a O 
monitoring O 
role O 
at O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
, O 
but O 
now O

that O

" O 
which O 
has O 
stirred O 
up O

Instead O 
, O 
said O 
Wang B-PER 
, O 
the O 
MJIB B-ORG 
will O 
concentrate O 
on O 
" O

Questions O

the O

the O 
MJIB B-ORG 
have O 
reopened O 
public O 
debate O 
on O

The O 
MJIB B-ORG

responsible O 
for O 
both O 
political O 
intelligence O

criminal O 
investigations O 
, O 
and O 
is O 
nominally O 
under O 
the B-ORG 
Ministry I-ORG

Justice I-ORG 
. O 

Its O 
work O 
overlaps O 
with O 
that O 
of O 
the O 
NSB B-ORG 
, O 
and O 
the O 
existence O 
of O 
two O 
different O 
chains O 
of O 
command O 
inevitably O 
creates O 
problems O 
. O 

The O 
IRA B-ORG 
has O 
pointed O 
out O 
, O 
for O 
example O 
, O 
that O 
MJIB B-ORG 
investigators O 
often O 
receive O 
oral O 
instructions O 
from O 
the O 
NSB O 
to O 
collect O 
information O 
on O

The B-ORG 
Ministry I-ORG

, O 
in O 
the O

, O 
repeatedly O 
calls O 
upon O 
the O

The O

, O 
VIA B-ORG 
's O 
chipsets O 
were O 
designed O 
completely O 
to O 
support O 
Intel B-ORG 
specification O 
CPUs O 
. O 

In O 
1998 O 
, O 
when O 
Intel B-ORG 
insisted O 
on O 
sticking O 
with O 
expensive O 
Rambus B-ORG 
memory O 
chips O 
despite O 
a O 
poor O 
market O 
response O 
, O 
VIA B-ORG 
saw O 
its O 
opportunity O 
: O 

For O 
the O 
first O 
time O 
, O 
VIA B-ORG 
had O 
challenged O 
the O 
" O 
big O 
boss O 
, O 
" O 
Intel B-ORG 
. O 

In O 
the O 
latter O 
half O 
of O 
1999 O 
, O 
VIA B-ORG 
acquired O 
two O 
CPU O 
companies O 
in O 
the O 
States B-LOC 
, O 
giving O 
it O 
an O 
independent O 
ability O 
to O 
develop O 
CPUs O 
. O 

In O 
these O 
ways O 
, O 
VIA B-ORG 
is O 
moving O 
step O 
by O 
step O 
to O 
enlarge O 
its O 
intellectual O 
holdings O 
. O 

It O 
is O 
only O 
now O 
that O 
VIA B-ORG 
can O 
escape O 
from O 
the O 
specifications O 
dictated O 
by O 
large O 
multinational O 
firms O 
, O 
and O 
create O 
innovative O 
products O 
of O 
its O 
own O 
. O 

VIA B-ORG 
has O 
designed O 
a O 
new O 
3 O

in O 
- O 
1 O 
chipset O 
which O 
includes O 
CPU O 
, O 
memory O 
, O 
and O

, O 
which O 
are O 
expected O 
to O 
formally O 
hit O 
the O 
market O 
in O 
the O 
first O 
half O 
of O 
2001 O 
. O 

This O 
is O 
precisely O 
the O 
problem O 
now O 
being O 
faced O 
by O 
Comdek B-ORG 
, O 
the O 
first O 
company O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
to O 
produce O 
medical O 
instruments O 
such O 
as O

Kuo I-PER 
, O 
general O 
manager O 
at O 
Comdek B-ORG 
, O 
points O 
out O 
that O 
the O 
quick O 
and O 
easy O 
process O 
of O 
taking O 
body O 
temperature O 
through O 
the O 
ear O 
was O 
developed O 
by O 
an O 
American O 
company O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
German O 
giant O 
Boehringer-Ingelheim B-ORG 
paid O 
a O 
huge O 
amount O 
of O 
money O 
for O 
the O 
patent O 
so O 
they O 
could O 
begin O 
production O 
. O 

Comdek B-ORG 
took O 
the O 
basic O 
principle O 
, O 
and O 
went O 
to O 
work O 
on O 
it O 
, O 
eventually O 
coming O 
up O 
with O 
their O 
own O 
version O 
, O 
for O 
which O 
they O 
have O 
been O 
awarded O 
a O 
patent O 
. O 

But O 
when O 
Comdek B-ORG 
's O 
product O 
came O 
out O 
, O 
Michael B-PER 
Kuo I-PER 
still O 
found O 
himself O 
in O 
a O 
vicious O 
struggle O 
with O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
pirate O 
firms O 
: O 
" O 
It O 
's O 
equivalent O 
to O 
making O 
fools O 
out O 
of O 
those O 
of O 
us O 
who O 
invest O 
the O 
money O 
to O 
do O 
research O 
and O 
development O 
! O 
" O 

Comdek B-ORG 
has O 
closed O 
its O 
laboratory O 
and O 
production O 
line O 
to O 
any O 
outside O 
visits O 
, O 
and O 
has O 
not O 
ruled O 
out O 
the O 
possibility O 
of O 
moving O 
its O 
lab O 
overseas O 
to O 
get O 
away O 
from O 
industrial O 
espionage O 
in O

What O

the O

One O 
reason O

that O

Ritek B-ORG

CEO O 
, O

little O 
more O 
than O

At O 
the O 
age O 
of O 
60 O 
, O 
he O 
created O 
Ritek B-ORG

is O

Almost O 
all O 
of O 
the O 
musicians O 
on O 
hand O 
for O 
the O 
launch O 
had O 
heard O 
of O 
Yeh B-PER 
, O 
but O 
very O 
few O 
knew O 
that O 
he O 
was O 
the O 
CEO O 
of O 
Ritek B-ORG 
, O 
a O 
company O 
worth O 
billions O 
of O 
NT O 
dollars O 
. O 

Before O 
founding O 
Ritek B-ORG 
, O 
Yeh B-PER 
was O 
already O 
a O 
well O 
- O 
known O 
figure O 
in O 
the O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
recording O 
industry O 
. O 

It O 
was O 
n't O 
until O 
1979 O 
, O 
when O 
Hsu B-PER 
delivered O 
an O 
impassioned O 
speech O 
at O 
the B-ORG 
Sanchung I-ORG 
Rotary I-ORG 
Club I-ORG 
about O 
this O 
problem O 
, O 
that O 
it O 
struck O 
a O 
chord O 
with O 
someone O 
who O 
could O 
do O 
something O 
about O 
it O 
. O 

At O 
that O 
time O 
Yeh B-PER 
Chin I-PER 
- I-PER 
tai I-PER 
was O 
CEO O 
of O 
First B-ORG

, O 
which O 
subsequently O 
released O 
a O

of O 
21 O

so O 
forth O

" O 
It O 
's O 
not O 
that O 
I O 
'm O 
especially O 
fond O 
of O 
music O 
or O

, O 
" O 
says O 
Yeh B-PER 
, O 
who O 
studied O 
engineering O 
in O 
the O 
last O 
Japanese O 
- O 
era O 
class O 
of O 
what O 
became O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG

Back O 
in O 
the O 
early O 
1950s O 
the O 
24 O 
- O 
year O 
- O 
old O 
Yeh B-PER 
worked O 
with O 
the B-ORG 
Broadcasting I-ORG 
Corporation I-ORG 
of I-ORG 
China I-ORG 
to O 
record O 
albums O 
of O 
BCC B-ORG 
singers O 
on O 
equipment O 
the O 
Japanese O 
army O 
had O 
left O 
behind O 
. O 

Later O 
Yeh B-PER 
established O 
the O 
Platinum B-ORG 
Music I-ORG 
recording O 
studio O 
and O 
went O 
abroad O 
to O 
keep O 
up O 
on O 
the O 
latest O 
industry O 
trends O 
. O 

Platinum B-ORG 
is O 
still O 
going O 
, O 
run O 
by O 
senior O 
recording O 
engineer O 
Yeh B-PER 
Chui I-PER

Ching I-PER 
, O 
who O 
is O 
Yeh B-PER 
Chin I-PER 
- I-PER 
tai I-PER 
's I-PER 
oldest O 
son O 
. O 

After O 
graduating O 
from O 
college O 
, O 
Yeh B-PER 
opened O 
the B-ORG 
Mingli I-ORG 
Plastics I-ORG 
Factory I-ORG 
. O 

In O 
was O 
in O 
this O 
period O 
that O 
he O 
met O 
the O 
owner O 
of O 
the O 
factory O 
across O 
from O 
his O 
, O 
who O 
was O 
a O 
National B-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
member O 
. O 

Through O 
him O 
, O 
Yeh B-PER 
reestablished O 
connections O 
with O 
BCC B-ORG 
and O 
once O 
again O 
threw O 
himself O 
into O 
the O 
recording O 
industry O 
. O 

Back O 
when O 
CDs O 
were O 
still O 
in O 
their O 
infancy O 
, O 
Yeh B-PER 
relied O 
on O 
his O 
old O 
relationship O 
with O 
Sony B-ORG 
and O 
found O 
a O 
team O 
of O 
engineers O 
associated O 
with O 
the B-ORG 
Industrial I-ORG 
Technology I-ORG 
Research I-ORG 
Institute I-ORG 
before O 
he O 
made O 
a O 
push O 
into O 
CD O 
production O 
. O 

Starting O 
from O 
simple O 
pieces O 
of O 
compressed O 
plastic O 
, O 
they O 
went O 
one O 
step O 
at O 
a O 
time O 
, O 
building O 
a O 
sturdy O 
foundation O 
of O 
technical O 
knowledge O 
that O 
Ritek B-ORG 
still O 
enjoys O 
today O 
. O 

In O 
1990 O 
Ritek B-ORG 
started O 
to O 
press O 
CDs O 
, O 
becoming O 
the O 
first O 
mass O 
- O 
production O 
manufacturer O 
of O 
CDs O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
. O 

Ritek B-ORG 
garnered O 
market O 
share O 
by O 
undercutting O 
the O 
competition O 
and O 
charging O 
only O 
NT$ O 
50 O 
. O 

With O 
the O 
support O 
that O 
Yeh B-PER 
had O 
long O 
enjoyed O 
in O 
the O 
recording O 
industry O 
here O 
, O 
Ritek B-ORG 
was O 
easily O 
able O 
to O 
market O 
its O 
goods O 
. O 

What O 
really O 
brought O 
Ritek B-ORG 
into O 
the O 
realm O 
of O 
high O 
- O 
technology O 
was O 
developing O 
its O 
own O 
CD O 
- O 
Rs O 
-LRB- O 
recordable O 
CDs O 
-RRB- O 
. O 

Taking O 
a O 
different O 
tack O 
from O 
the O 
Japanese O 
, O 
who O 
were O 
plating O 
CD O 
- O 
Rs O 
with O 
a O 
thin O 
gold O 
layer O 
, O 
Ritek B-ORG 
instead O 
developed O 
a O 
cheap O 
and O 
high O 
- O 
quality O 
process O 
for O 
coating O 
them O 
with O 
silver O 
or O 
aluminum O 
. O 

Being O 
competitive O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
price O 
is O 
one O 
of O 
Ritek B-ORG 
's O 
strong O 
points O 
, O 
but O 
it O 
's O 
not O 
the O 
whole O 
story O 
behind O 
the O 
company O 
's O 
success O 
. O 

Automation O 
has O 
meant O 
that O 
the O 
workers O 
have O 
had O 
to O 
learn O 
how O 
to O 
operate O 
sophisticated O 
machinery O 
and O 
computers O 
, O 
so O 
that O 
Ritek B-ORG 
has O 
advanced O 
out O 
of O 
the O 
ranks O 
of O 
the O 
traditional O 
plastic O 
disc O 
pressers O 
. O 

Yet O 
Ritek B-ORG 
has O 
still O 
managed O 
to O 
maintain O 
operating O 
profits O 
of O 
22 O 
% O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
falling O 
prices O 
have O 
n't O 
crushed O 
it O 
. O 

The O 
coming O 
wave O 
of O 
technology O 
will O 
focus O 
on O 
light O 
and O 
small O 
portable O 
data O 
devices O 
such O 
as O 
PDAs O 
and O 
MP3 O 
players O 
, O 
so O 
the O 
challenge O 
for O 
Ritek B-ORG 
is O 
allowing O 
devices O 
that O 
are O 
becoming O 
smaller O 
and O 
smaller O 
to O 
have O 
larger O 
data O 
capacities O 
and O 
higher O 
fidelity O 
. O 

Yeh B-PER 
points O 
out O 
that O 
the O 
patent O 
rights O 
for O 
mini-discs O 
are O 
owned O 
entirely O 
by O 
big O 
Japanese O 
companies O 
, O 
but O 
Ritek B-ORG 
is O 
the O 
only O 
company O 
manufacturing O 
them O 
. O 

Ritek B-ORG 
is O 
also O 
part O 
of O 
a O 
group O 
-LRB- O 
which O 
includes O 
Dataplay B-ORG 
, O 
Samsung B-ORG 
and O 
Toshiba B-ORG 
-RRB- O 
that O 
is O 
researching O 
and O 
developing O 
a O 
data O 
storage O 
device O 
no O 
larger O 
than O 
a O 
wrist O 
watch O 
, O 
as O 
well O 
as O 
the O 
applications O 
for O 
it O 
. O 

Ritek B-ORG 
will O 
be O 
responsible O 
for O 
the O 
production O 
of O 
the O 
disk O 
. O 

A O 
year O 
and O 
a O 
half O 
ago O 
Ritek B-ORG 
invested O 
in O 
the O 
production O 
of O

-LRB- O 
organic O 
light O 
- O 
emitting O 
diode O 
-RRB- O 
displays O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
yet O 
another O 
technology O 
used O 
in O 
portable O 
computing O 
devices O 
that O 
relies O 
on O 
thin O 
opto O

electrical O 
film O 
application O 
techniques O 
. O 

Currently O 
Ritek B-ORG 
is O 
the O 
largest O 
producer O 
of O 
OLEDs O 
in O 
the O 
world O 
. O 

Ritek B-ORG 
has O 
also O 
begun O 
to O 
explore O 
fiber O 
optics O 
used O 
in O 
the O 
information O 
industry O 
. O 

Last O 
year O 
Ritek B-ORG 
invested O 
in O 
production O 
of O

with O

Memory I-ORG 
Technology I-ORG

by O 
TMT B-ORG 
sell O 
for O 
US$ O 
7 O 
a O 
piece O 
. O 

He O 
often O 
cites O 
the O 
example O 
of O 
the O 
owner O 
of O 
the O 
Japanese O 
fast O 
food O 
chain O 
Yoshinoya B-ORG 
, O 
who O 
predicted O 
as O 
early O 
as O 
1980 O 
, O 
when O 
there O 
was O 
a O 
great O 
US B-LOC

, O 
that O 
America B-LOC 
would O 
force O 
Japan B-LOC 
to O 
open O 
its O 
beef O 
market O 
. O 

As O 
a O 
result O 
, O 
Yoshinoya B-ORG 
struggled O 
for O 
many O 
years O 
and O 
nearly O 
went O 
bankrupt O 
. O 

For O 
the O 
past O 
two O 
years O

however O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
has O 
been O 
open O 
to O

and O 
Yoshinoya B-ORG 
has O 
done O 
very O 
well O

Possessing O 
a O 
corporate O 
farsightedness O 
and O 
determination O 
that O 
is O 
similar O 
to O 
Yoshinoya B-ORG 
, O 
Ritek B-ORG 
has O 
been O 
groping O 
its O 
way O

This O 
turned O 
out O 
to O 
be O 
the O 
most O 
divisive O 
case O 
the O 
Council B-ORG 
has O 
ever O 
heard O 
. O 

Once O 
such O 
legislation O 
has O 
been O 
promulgated O 
into O

by O 
the O

wrote O

Justice O

authored O 
a O 
partial O 
dissenting O 
opinion O 
arguing O 
that O

the O 
duty O 
of O 
the B-ORG

of I-ORG 
Grand I-ORG 
Justices I-ORG 
to O 
rule O 
on O

issues O 
, O 
the O 
Council B-ORG 
ought O 
to O 
state O 
clearly O 
whether O 
or O 
not O 
the O 
constitution O 
had O 
been O 
violated O 
. O 

Justice O 
Tung B-PER 
Hsiang I-PER

pointed O 
that O 
legislation O 
barring O 
construction O

the O 
nuclear O 
power O

had O 
already O 
been O 
passed O 
twice O

and O 
was O 
successfully O 
vetoed O 
each O

by O 
the O 
previous O 
Kuomintang B-ORG 
administration O 
. O 

Noting O 
that O 
the O 
project O 
got O 
underway O 
several O 
years O 
ago O 
, O 
Tung B-PER 
argued O 
that O 
the O 
Cabinet B-ORG 
clearly O 
violated O 
the O 
constitution O 
when O 
it O 
unilaterally O 
suspended O 
the O 
project O 
on O 
the O 
grounds O 
that O 
a O 
new O 
party O 
had O 
come O 
to O 
power O 
and O 
its O 
party O 
platform O 
was O

, O 
Secretary O

General O

stated O 
that O 
the O 
president O 
would O 
respect O 
the O 
ruling O 
of O 
the O 
Grand O 
Justices O 
, O 
but O 
said O 
the O 
language O 
of O 
the O 
ruling O 
does O 
not O 
appear O 
to O 
require O 
a O 
Cabinet B-ORG 
reshuffle O 
. O 

The O 
various O 
opposition O 
caucuses O 
in O 
the O 
legislature O 
issued O 
a O 
joint O 
statement O 
arguing O 
that O 
in O 
describing O 
the O 
decision O 
to O 
suspend O 
construction O 
of O 
the O 
plant O 
as O 
" O 
procedurally O 
flawed O 
, O 
" O 
the O 
Grand O 
Justices O 
had O 
in O 
effect O 
declared O 
the O 
Cabinet B-ORG 
's O 
unilateral O 
action O 
illegal O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
Cabinet B-ORG 
's O 
action O 
has O 
naturally O 
lost O 
legal O 
validity O 
for O 
that O 
reason O

in O 
this O 
case O 
, O 
the O 
crux O 
of O 
the O

about O 
the O 
use O 
of O

Hsu B-PER 
notes O 
that O 
while O 
the O 
ruling O 
pointed O 
to O 
procedural O 
flaws O 
in O 
the O 
Cabinet B-ORG 
's O 
action O 
, O 
the O 
ruling O 
said O 
nothing O 
about O 
any O 
violation O 
of O 
the O 
constitution O 
or O 
the O 
law O 
. O 

Last O 
March O 
the O 
Grand O 
Justices O 
rendered O 
a O 
constitutional O 
interpretation O 
when O 
the O 
ruling O

opposition O 
parties O 
were O 
wrangling O 
over O 
a O 
proposed O 
term O 
extension O 
for O 
all O 
members O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
. O 

The O 
justices O 
ruled O 
that O 
the O 
decision O 
making O 
process O 
violated O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
's I-ORG 
rules O 
of O

went O 
against O 
the O 
principle O 
that O 
all O

must O 
be O 
open O 
and O 
transparent O 
. O 

After O 
the O 
term O 
extension O 
was O 
declared O 
invalid O 
, O 
retaliatory O 
constitutional O 
amendments O 
were O 
proposed O 
in O

to O 
abolish O 
the B-ORG

strip O 
the O

A O 
constitutional O 
ruling O 
by O 
the B-ORG 
Council I-ORG

Justices I-ORG 
appears O 
to O 
have O 
moved O 
the O

his O

At O 
age O 
20 O 
Wang B-PER 
went O 
to O 
Beiping B-LOC

as O 
Beijing B-LOC

the O 
National O

, O 
explains O 
that O 
the O 
art O 
of O 
Chinese B-PER 
calligraphy O 
can O 
broadly O 
be O 
divided B-PER 
into I-PER 
two O 
main O 
branches O 
: O 
the O 
nantie O 
, O 
or O 
Southern O 
style O 
, O 
in O 
which O 
beauty O 
of O 
form O 
is O 
emphasized O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
more O 
rugged O 
beibei O 
or O 
Northern O 
style O 
. O 

It O 
was O 
a O 
style O 
well O 
suited O 
to O 
the O 
kind B-ORG 
of I-ORG 
man I-ORG 
he O 
was O 
: O 
a O 
bluff O 
northerner O 
with O 
the O 
perfectionist O 
's O 
approach O 
to O 
art O 
. O 

Despite O 
the O 
interest B-ORG 
generated B-ORG 
among B-ORG 
calligraphers I-ORG 
by O 
these B-ORG 
innovations I-ORG 
, O 
Wang O 
was O 
more O 
suited O 
by O 
temperament O 
to O 
the O 
established O 
forms O 
, O 
and O 
he O 
eventually O 
turned O 
back O 
to O 
ancients O 
for O 
inspiration O 
. O 

In O 
studying B-PER 
the O 
calligraphy O 
of O 
ancient O 
times O 
he O 
broke O 
through O 
limitations O 
, O 
one O 
after B-ORG 
another I-ORG 
, O 
so O

his B-ORG 
calligraphy I-ORG

simple O

raw O 
life O

rushes O 
in O 
to O 
see O 
what O

But O 
the O 
most O 
important O 
reason O 
why O 
the B-ORG 
Yingko I-ORG 
Ceramics I-ORG 
Museum I-ORG 
gave O 
him O 
sole O 
and O 
total O 
control O

36 O

Thus O 
the B-ORG

only O

borrow O

that O

quickly O 
hit O 
the O 
shoals O

NTU B-ORG

the O
