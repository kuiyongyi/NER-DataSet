why O

we O 
surprised O

learn O 
that O 
Michael B-PER

n't O 
want O 
to O 
grow O

that O 
he O 
prefers O 
the O

that O 
he O 
wants O 
to O 
be O 
protected O

looked O 
after O

18:2 O 
And O 
he O 
cried O 
mightily O

a O 
strong O

saying O

Perhaps O 
the O

What O 
is O 
Professor B-PER 
Zhang I-PER

purpose O 
in O 
his O

there O
