within O

it O

was O 
going O

It O 
should O 
be O 
mentioned O 
that O

will O

continue O

I O

it O

against O

taking O 
personal O 
risk O 
, O 
and O 
in O

you O 
do O 
n't O 
see O 
that O 
risk O

what O 
you O 
would O 
find O 
in O

In O 
a O 
way O 
presidents O 
do O 
n't O 
normally O 
pay O 
as O 
much O 
attention O 
to O 
Northern B-LOC 
Ireland I-LOC 
as O 
Clinton B-PER 
has O 
, O 
so O 
he O 
has O 
actually O 
paid O 
the O 
Irish O 
question O 
probably O 
too O 
much O 
attention O 
for O 
a O 
President O 
, O 
and O 
what O 
that O 
means O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
people O 
involved O 
in O 
the O

here O 
believe O 
they O 
are O 
more O

he O 
also O 
did O 
something O

not O

ah O 
all O

the O

to O

all O

at O 
the O

with O 
all O

because O

, O 
of O

I O 
did O

it O

then O 
decide O 
if O 
there O 
was O 
reason O 
for O 
a O

but O 
the B-ORG

it O

, O 
there O 
are O

you O 
mentioned O 
, O 
the O 
last O 
trial O

was O 
actually O 
the O 
trial O

Gary B-PER

1961 O

and O 
Gary B-PER 
Powers I-PER 
was O 
shot O 
down O 
over O 
Russia B-LOC 
, O 
so O 
his O 
guilt O 
was O 
fairly O 
firmly O 
established O 
and O 
ever O 
since O 
then O 
any O 
suspected O 
spies O 
were O 
usually O 
either O 
sort O 
of O 
simply O 
kicked O 
out O

the O

expelled O

they O
