If O

we O 
might O 
not O

anything O

The O

if O

I O 
do O

Recall O 
the O

the O 
District B-LOC

If O 
you O 
want O 
to O 
look O 
down O 
the O 
road O 
, O 
think O 
about O 
what O 
is O 
going O 
to O 
happen O 
after O 
we O 
spend O 
a O 
few O 
billion O 
to O 
meet O 
the O 
Chesapeake B-LOC

Once O 
we O 
stop O 
putting O 
it O

the O

we O 
are O 
going O 
to O 
have O 
to O 
put O 
it O 
on O 
the O 
land O 
. O 

The O 
more O 
stuff O 
you O 
have O 
the O 
more O 
stuff O 
you O 
need O 
to O 
maintain O 
it O 
, O 
like O 
the O 
Virginia B-LOC

For O 
many O 
of O 
us O 
our O 
life O 
has O 
come O 
down O

it O

take O 
it O

Even O 
if O 
you O 
buy O 
it O 
at O 
the O

it O 
is O

, O 
if O 
PEC B-ORG 
wants O 
to O 
make O 
a O 
supporter O 
out O 
of O 
me O 
, O 
the O 
way O 
to O 
do O 
it O 
is O 
to O 
start O 
a O 
campaign O 
that O 
ensures O 
things O

How O 
about O 
a O

If O 
the O 
GA B-ORG 
repealed O 
the O

the O

would O 
pick O 
up O 
some O

Or O 
, O 
the O 
GA B-ORG 
could O 
actually O 
cut O 
the O

That O 
is O 
what O 
an O

I O 
'll O 
oppose O 
any O

of O 
more O

from O

until O 
we O 
get O

'' O 

I O 
'll O 
bet O 
you O 
I O 
'd O 
get O 
more O 
votes O 
from O

than O 
a O

who O 
says O 
we O 
need O 
to O 
continue O 
the O 
status O

, O 
but O 
with O 
more O 
funding O 
for O 
VDOT B-ORG 
. O 

people O 
whose O 
costs O 
include O 
supporting O 
the B-LOC 
Dulles I-LOC 
Toll I-LOC 
road I-LOC 
are O 
also O 
supporting O 
the O

make O 
it O 
possible O 
for O

to O 
live O 
in O

When O 
Virginia B-LOC 
does O 
systematically O 
explore O 
these O 
ideas O 
they O 
may O 
very O 
well O 
come O 
to O 
the O 
conclusion O 
that O 
Fundamental O 
Change O 
is O 
a O 
really O 
lousy O 
idea O 
, O 
and O 
that O 
, O 
bad O 
as O 
it O 
is O 
, O 
business O 
as O 
usual O 
is O 
the O 
best O 
option O 
after O 
all O 
. O 

I O 
see O 
what O 
TMT B-PER 
says O 
as O 
the O 
other O 
side O 
of O 
the O 
same O 
coin O 
I O 
described O 
above O 
. O 

If O 
we O 
get O 
APF's O 
they O 
will O 
be O 
disproportionately O 
used O 
against O 
those O 
who O 
are O 
`` O 
left O 
out O 
'' O 
of O 
development O 
plans O 
, O 
and O 
consequently O 
used O 
to O 
ram O 
still O 
more O 
development O 
down O 
TMT B-PER 
's O 
throat O 
. O 

Will B-PER 
Rogers I-PER 
once O 
joked O 
that O 
if O 
you O 
wanted O 
to O 
cure O 
traffic O 
congestion O 
, O 
just O 
make O 
people O 
pay O 
cash O 
for O 
their O 
cars O 
up O 
front O 
. O 

APF's O 
are O 
a O 
good O 
idea O 
only O 
if O 
you O 
are O 
willing O 
to O 
provide O 
a O 
dedicated O 
and O 
adequate O 
funding O 
stream O 
for O 
them O 
, O 
same O 
as O 
for O 
Metro B-LOC 
. O 

I O 
do O 
n't O 
have O 
online O 
access O 
to O 
the O 
WSJ B-ORG 
, O 
but O 
did O 
it O 
really O 
refer O 
to O 
the O 
`` O 
general O 
assembling O 
'' O 
and O 
did O 
it O 
also O 
fault O 
Kaine B-PER 
for O 
`` O 
trying O 
to O 
raise O 
gasoline O 
taxes O 
? O 
'' O 

If O 
so O 
, O 
does O 
the O 
WSJ B-ORG 
have O 
a O 
fact O 
checker O 
on O 
staff O 
? O 

Not B-PER 
Grover I-PER 
, O 
Thanks O 
for O 
catching O 
my O 
typo O 
. O 

And O 
that O 
's O 
a O 
good O 
point O 
about O 
Kaine B-PER 
's O 
`` O 
gasoline O 
tax O 
. O 
'' O 

But O 
was O 
not O 
the O 
point O 
of O 
both O 
the O 
Kaine B-PER 
and O 
the O 
Senate B-ORG 
tax O 
plans O 
to O 
NOT O 
tax O 
gasoline O 
at O 
the O

-- O 
indeed O 
to O 
tax O 
anything O 
but O 
gasoline O 
at O 
the O 
pump O 
? O 

In O 
that O 
case O 
, O 
the O 
WSJ B-ORG 
got O 
its O 
information O 
very O 
wrong O 
. O 

That O 
kind O 
of O 
behavior O 
makes O 
you O 
think O 
there O 
might O 
be O 
some O 
value O 
in O 
Albo B-PER 
's O 
plan O 
to O 
increase O 
fines O 
for O 
really O 
bad O 
drivers O 
, O 
especially O 
since O 
almost O 
a O 
third O 
of O 
traffic O 
cogestion O 
is O 
caused O 
by O 
incidents O 
. O 

Jim B-PER 
, O 
I O 
agree O 
with O 
most O 
of O 
your O 
proposals O 
, O 
or O 
at O 
least O 
the O 
goals O 
you O 
hope O 
to O 
achieve O 
with O 
them O 
. O 

I O 
agree O 
with O 
Ray B-PER 
that O 
even O 
non-users O 
of O 
transportation O 
facilities O 
benefit O 
from O 
them O 
, O 
but O 
I O 
do O 
favor O 
higher O 
gas O 
taxes O 
and O 
other O 
directly O 
related O 
user O 
fees O 
. O 

Ray B-PER 
, O 
I O 
'm O 
surprised O 
you O 
think O 
we O 
ca O 
n't O 
do O 
more O 
teleworking O 
. O 

Jim B-PER 
, O 
you O 
may O 
have O 
a O 
clear O 
vision O 
in O 
your O 
head O 
about O 
what O 
that O 
threshold O 
is O 
, O 

I O 
think O 
EMR B-PER 
convinced O 
me O 
that O 
those O 
that O 
really O 
can O 
telework O 
already O 
do O 
so O 
. O 

but O 
Ed B-PER 
suggests O 
the O 
well O 
is O 
not O 
as O 
deep O 
as O 
we O 
would O 
like O 
to O 
believe O 
. O 

it O 
is O 
OK O 
for O 
the O 
general O 
public O 
or O 
auto O 
drivers O 
-LRB- O 
which O 
is O 
much O 
the O 
same O 
thing O 
-RRB- O 
to O 
provide O 
some O 
support O 
for O 
transit O 
because O 
there O 
is O 
some O 
-LRB- O 
small O 
-RRB- O 
benefit O 
to O 
everyone O 
for O 
those O 
that O 
are O 
able O 
and O 
willing O 
to O 
use O 
Metro B-LOC 
etc. O 

Not O 
only O 
is O 
Virginia B-LOC 
heading O 
for O 
a O 
fiscal O 
crisis O 
, O 
but O 
it O 
may O 
be O 
heading O 
for O 
a O 
constitutional O 
crisis O 
as O 
well O 
. O 

The O 
Senate B-ORG 
and O 
House B-ORG 
of I-ORG 
Delegates I-ORG 
managed O 
to O 
get O 
budget O 
talks O 
back O 
on O 
track O 
last O 
week O 
, O 

but O 
negotiations O 
derailed O 
faster O 
than O 
an O 
Amtrak B-ORG

in O 
a O

. O 

Judging O 
by O 
the O 
exchange O 
of O 
letters O 
released O 
to O 
the O 
public O 
, O 
relations O 
between O 
the O 
Senate B-ORG

budget O 
conferees O 
are O 
as O 
acrimonious O 
as O 
they O 
've O 
ever O 
been O 
. O 

Gov. O 
Timothy B-PER 
M. I-PER 
Kaine I-PER 
says O 
he O 
has O 
the O 
authority O 
to O 
keep O 
basic O

a O

But O 
Attorney O

Meanwhile O 
, O 
senior O 
state O 
lawmakers O 
are O 
due O 
to O 
visit O 
bond O 
rating O 
agencies O 
in O 
New B-LOC 
York I-LOC 
. O 

Virginia B-LOC 
may O 
be O 
the O 
best O 
managed O 
state O 
in O 
the O 
country O 
when O 
the O 
politicians O 
are O 
actually O 
speaking O 
to O 
one O 
another O 
, O 
but O 
it O 
's O 
not O 
looking O 
terribly O 
well O 
managed O 
right O 
now O 
. O 

Only O 
two O 
years O 
ago O 
, O 
on O 
the O 
heels O 
of O 
the O 
last O 
recession O 
, O 
Virginia B-LOC 
's O 
political O 
class O 
was O 
consternated O 
that O 
the O 
state O 
's O 
AAA O 
bond O 
rating O 
might O 
be O 
cut O 
. O 

Would O 
n't O 
it O 
be O 
ironic O 
if O 
, O 
despite O 
the O 
2004 O 
tax O 
increase O 
and O 
a O 
$ O 
1.5 O 
billion O 
surplus O 
, O 
the O 
rating O 
agencies O 
cut O 
Virginia B-LOC 
's O 
bond O 
rating O 
anyway O 
this O 
year O 
? O 

It O 
would O 
appear O 
given O 
the O 
deadlocks O 
and O 
disputes O 
that O 
have O 
afflicted O 
our O 
General B-ORG 
Assembly I-ORG 
since O 
2001 O 
, O 
the O 
vaunted O 
Republican O 
majority O 
is O 
just O 
not O 
now O 
nor O 
has O 
it O 
ever O 
been O 
ready O 
for O 
prime O 
time O 
governing O 
. O 

Why O 
Mr. O 
Atticus B-PER 
Bowden I-PER 
, O 
if O 
`` O 
ever O 
'' O 
were O 
hyperbole O 
perhaps O 
you O 
could O 
tell O 
me O 
when O 
they O 
did O 
manage O 
to O 
govern O 
-- O 
all O 
by O 
themselves O 
, O 
of O 
course O 
? O 

We O 
in O 
Virginia B-LOC 
drank O 
the O 
Kool O

aid O 
and O 
elected O 
a O 
bunch O 
of O 
culture O 
warrior O 
idealogues O 
instead O 
of O 
good O 
, O 
pragmatic O 
stewards O 
. O 

I O 
believe O 
that O 
it O 
would O 
be O 
better O 
to O 
imperil O 
our O 
bond O 
rating O 
than O 
to O 
pass O 
a O 
budget O 
that O 
continues O 
the O 
taxation O 
practices O 
of O 
the O 
past O 
two O 
general B-ORG 
assemblies I-ORG 
. O 

Anon O 
: O 
The O 
GOP B-ORG 
majority O 
did O 
fine O 
with O 
the O 
Car O

relief O 
from O 
the O 
2000 O

until O 
the O 
2002 O

when O

the O

. O 

I O 
agree O 
, O 
that O 
Republicans O 
have O 
n't O 
covered O 
themselves O 
in O 
glory O 
in O 
the O 
GA B-ORG 
in O 
the O 
few O 
years O 
our O

been O 
in O

Update O 
: O 
Reason O 
prevailed O 
on O 
the O 
`` O 
caboose O 
bill O 
'' O 
and O 
the O 
House B-ORG 
backed O 
off O 
a O 
last O 
minute O 
amendment O 
that O 
the O 
Senate B-ORG 
would O 
n't O 
go O 
along O 
with O 
, O 
so O 
at O 
least O 
that O 
budget O 
is O 
done O 
. O 

To O 
see O 
this O 
going O 
on O 
in O 
Virginia B-LOC 
now O 
is O 
truly O 
an O 
embarrassment O 
. O 

The O 
Senate B-ORG 
gave O 
in O 
on O 
its O 
main O 
point O 
weeks O

and O 
if O 
we O 
reach O

with O 
no O

, O 
it O 
is O 
on O 
the O

Ronald B-PER

who O

the O

no O

presumably O 
wo O 
n't O 
go O 
out O 

and O 
what O 
is O 
really O 
going O 
on O 
is O 
the O 
GA B-ORG 
equivalent O 
of O 
two O 
cars O 
speeding O 
towards O 
each O 
other O 
until O 
someone O 
blinks O 
. O 

I O 
'll O 
also O 
predict O 
... O 
that O 
the O 
classic O 
fall O 
- O 
back O 
position O 
for O 
Virginia B-LOC 
is O 
the O 
same O 
one O 
used O 
by O 
the O 
Feds O 
- O 

But O 
salvation O 
has O 
come O 
from O 
an O 
unlikely O 
suitor O 
- O 
an O 
Australian O 
company O 
called O 
Transurban B-ORG 
that O 
has O 
agreed O 
to O 
pay O 
the B-ORG 
Virginia I-ORG 
Department I-ORG 
of I-ORG 
Transportation I-ORG 
$ O 
522 O 
million O 
in O 
exchange O 
for O 
a O 
99 O 
- O 
year O 
lease O 
of O 
the O 
road O 
. O 

That O 
an O 
Australian O 
company O 
has O 
agreed O 
to O 
spend O 
$ O 
522 O 
million O 
on O 
Pocahontas B-LOC 
Parkway I-LOC 
, O 
a O 
road O 
that O 
last O 
year O 
collected O 
just O 
$ O 
10.3 O 
million O 
in O 
tolls O 
. O 

In O 
exchange O 
for O 
the O 
right O 
to O 
keep O 
all O 
parkway O 
toll O 
revenue O 
, O 
Transurban B-ORG 
agreed O 
to O 
build O 
a O 
1.6 O

, O 
four O

to O 
the B-LOC 
Richmond I-LOC 
International I-LOC

, O 
pending O 
federal O 
approval O

So O 
... O 
I O 
'd O 
ask O 
... O 
why O 
not O 
replicate O 
this O 
approach O 
to O 
some O 
of O 
our O 
more O 
urgent O 
transportation O 
problems O 
and O 
get O 
VDOT B-ORG

the O 
State O 
of O

out O 
of O 
the O 
business O 
of O

... O 
and O 
apparently O 
not O 
knowing O 
how O 
to O 
build O 
even O

that O 
will O 
be O

Is O 
this O 
why O

Reading O 
between O

lines O 
of O 
Gowen B-PER

story O 
, O 
however O 
, O 
there O 
seems O 
to O 
be O 
one O 
big O 
missing O 
piece O 
: O 

The O 
problem O 
, O 
I O 
surmise O 
-- O 
it O 
's O 
not O 
discussed O 
in O 
the O 
story O 
-- O 
is O 
that O 
Arlington B-LOC 
is O 
concerned O 
about O 
protecting O 
its O 
tax O 
base O 
, O 
which O 
means O 
replacing O 
the O 
vacated O 
offices O 
with O 
new O 
offices O 
, O 
not O 
housing O 
. O 

It O 
's O 
hard O 
to O 
fault O 
Arlington B-LOC 
for O 
pursuing O 
its O 
short O 
- O 
term O 
self O 
interest O 
. O 

But O 
everyone O 
needs O 
to O 
recognize O 
that O 
Arlington B-LOC 
's O 
decision O 
not O 
to O 
pursue O 
a O 
balanced O 
community O 
means O 
that O 
housing O 
will O 
end O 
up O 
somewhere O 
else O 
, O 
presumably O 
in O 
outlying O 
counties O 
. O 

Jim B-PER 
, O 
minor O 
point O 
- O 

unlike O 
most O 
other O 
Virginia B-LOC 
counties O 
, O 
Arlington B-LOC 
County I-LOC 
does O 
not O 
have O 
a B-ORG 
Board I-ORG 
of I-ORG

. O 

It O 
does O 
have O 
a B-ORG 
County I-ORG 
Board I-ORG 
. O 

Members O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Arlington I-ORG

are O 
addressed O 
not O 
as O

, O 
but O 
as O 
Board O 
Members O 
. O 

The O 
question O 
that O 
the O 
Arlington B-LOC 
community O 
needs O 
to O 
answer O 
is O 
: O 
Whether O 
the O 
supporting O 
infrastructure O 
is O 
sufficient O 
? O 

Moreover O 
, O 
while O 
I O 
'm O 
sure O 
that O 
many O 
people O 
would O 
enjoy O 
the O 
urban O 
life O 
of O 
a O 
newly O 
revitalized O 
Crystal B-LOC 
City I-LOC 
, O 
many O 
others O 
would O 
not O 
. O 

Many O 
people O 
simply O 
want O 
to O 
live O 
in O 
single O 
family O 
, O 
detached O 
homes O 
that O 
will O 
not O 
be O 
available O 
in O 
Crystal B-LOC 
City I-LOC 
. O 

Ray B-PER 
Hyde I-PER 
has O 
persuaded O 
me O 
that O 
we O 
need O 
to O 
provide O 
incentives O 
for O 
good O 
quality O 
, O 
higher O 
paying O 
jobs O 
to O 
locate O 
in O 
outlying O 
areas O 
. O 

Virginia B-LOC 
needs O 
balanced O 
job O 
growth O 
. O 

But O 
, O 
what O 
would O 
be O 
the O 
benefit O 
to O 
Arlington B-LOC 
to O 
do O 
this O 
? O 

More O 
specifically O 
- O 
what O 
would O 
be O 
the O 
benefit O 
to O 
those O 
who O 
already O 
live O 
and O 
pay O 
taxes O 
in O 
Arlington B-LOC 
? O 

What O 
would O 
Arlington B-LOC 
have O 
to O 
provide O 
in O 
the O 
way O 
of O 
additional O 
infrastructure O 
? O 

It O 
would O 
seem O 
to O 
be O 
that O 
if O 
you O 
took O 
an O 
office O 
building O 
in O 
Crystal B-LOC 
and O 
converted O 
it O 
to O 
apartments O 
.. O 
you O 
'd O 
not O 
have O 
any O 
more O 
people O 
-LRB- O 
perhaps O 
less O 
-RRB- O 
so O 
you O 
would O 
n't O 
need O 
any O 
more O 
water O 
/ O 
sewer O 
capacity O 
... O 
and O 
ditto O 
for O 
parking O 
places O 
... O 
at O 
least O 
it O 
would O 
seem O 
so O 
-RRB- O 
. O 

instead O 
of O 
a O 
hoard O 
of O 
folks O 
`` O 
in O 
commuting O 
'' O 
from O 
outer O 
jurisdictions O 
to O 
Arlington B-LOC 
every O 
morning O 
, O 
would O 
n't O 
you O 
have O 
instead O 
- O 
more O 
`` O 
out O 
'' O 
commuting O 
. O 

To O 
a O 
certain O 
extent O 
- O 
one O 
could O 
say O 
that O 
No B-LOC 
Va I-LOC 
jurisdictions O 
have O 
a O 
responsibility O 
to O 
provide O 
housing O 
for O 
those O 
that O 
work O 
in O 
the O 
same O 
area O 
and O 
NOT O 
force O 
workers O 
to O 
commute O 
to O 
outer O 
jursidictions O 
for O 
housing O 
in O 
the O 
first O 
place O 
. O 

What O 
kind O 
of O 
an O 
exercise O 
would O 
it O 
be O 
for O 
each O 
NoVa B-LOC 
jurisdiction O 
to O 
total O 
up O 
the O 
number O 
of O 
jobs O 
in O 
its O 
boundaries O 
verses O 
the O 
amount O 
of O 
housing O 
within O 
its O 
boundaries O 
. O 

In O 
other O 
words O 
a O 
huge O 
percent O 
of O 
our O 
population O 
are O 
, O 
in O 
fact O 
, O 
NoVa B-LOC 
commuters O 
. O 

With O 
respect O 
to O 
the O 
jobs O 
/ O 
housing O 
question O 
- O 
I O 
wonder O 
what O 
the O 
totals O 
would O 
be O 
for O 
the O 
entire O 
NoVa B-LOC 
area O 
- O 
all O 
jursidictions O 
with O 
respect O 
to O 
jobs O 
verses O 
housing O 
. O 

In O 
some O 
respects O 
, O 
is O 
n't O 
that O 
essentially O 
what O 
No B-LOC 
Va I-LOC 
jursidictions O 
are O 
doing O 
- O 
favoring O 
non-residential O 
development O 
and O 
letting O 
other O 
jursidictions O 
handle O 
the O 
residential O 
? O 

Turning O 
this O 
on O 
its O 
head O 
- O 
what O 
is O 
the O 
incentive O 
for O 
a O 
worker O 
in O 
Crystal B-LOC 
City I-LOC 
to O 
buy O 
there O 
? O 

but O 
if O 
I O 
bought O 
at O 
Crystal B-LOC 
City I-LOC 
, O 
I O 
'd O 
be O 
locked O 
in O 
to O 
that O 
area O

This O

conviction O 
: O 

Jim B-PER 
: O 
I O 
believe O 
in O 
free O

as O 
well O

but O 
I O 
also O 
hold O 
that O 
free O

are O 
equally O

free O 
of O

as O 
well O 
as O 
over O

burdensome O

None O 
of O 
us O 
would O 
likely O 
support O 
the O

We O 
have O 
a O 
serious O 
problem O 
with O 
public O

in O 
areas O 
of O 
Virginia B-LOC

Few O 
would O 
likely O 
argue O 
that O 
, O 
because O 
of O 
the O 
high O 
forward O

looking O 
costs O 
for O 
constructing O

, O 
we O 
should O 
not O 
permit O

The O 
article O 
should O 
put O 
to O 
rest O 
the O 
argument O 
that O 
Ed B-PER 
Risse I-PER 
and O 
I O 
have O 
had O 
about O 
job O 
growth O 
. O 

His O 
previous O 
statement O 
was O 
that O 
while O 
the O 
percet O 
job O 
growth O 
in O 
PW B-LOC 
was O 
high O 
the O 
absolute O 
number O 
was O 
small O 
. O 

Metro B-LOC 
will O 
not O 
ease O

it O 
has O 
n't O 
done O 
so O 
for O 
the O 
last O 
thirty O

. O 

Clearly O 
, O 
that O 
does O 
not O 
include O 
billing O 
the O 
tollroad O 
users O 
for O 
Metro B-LOC 
construction O 
. O 

I O 
'd O 
say O 
that O 
most O 
people O 
have O 
made O 
the O 
connection O 
and O 
that O 
the O 
one O 
Jay B-PER

is O 
just O 
wrong O 
. O 

Then O 
, O 
of O

there O 
is O 
the O 
apparently O 
obligatory O

generally O 
clueless O

I O 
understand O 
Larry B-PER

point O

it O

an O

Wall B-ORG

Journal I-ORG 
about O 
the O 
experiment O 
in O 
Stockholm B-LOC 
, O 
Sweden B-LOC 
, O 
with O 
congestion O 
pricing O 
. O 

The O 
Greater B-LOC 
Stockholm I-LOC 
region O 
has O 
nearly O 
two O 
million O 
people O 
. O 

Under O 
contract O 
with O 
IBM B-ORG 
, O 
the O 
national O 
government O 
has O 
set O 
up O 
23 O 
tolling O 
points O 
which O 
, O 
used O 
in O 
conjunction O 
with O 
transponder O 
boxes O 
, O 
laser O 
detectors O 
and O 
cameras O 
, O 
tracks O 
the O 
path O 
of O 
every O 
car O 
in O 
the O 
city O 
. O 

As O 
the O 
WSJ B-ORG 
explains O 
: O 
Before O 
the O 
trial O 
began O 
, O 
Stockholm B-LOC 
spent O 
about O 
$ O 
180 O 
million O 
on O 
improvements O 
to O 
public O 
transportation O 
. O 

So O 
far O 
, O 
the O 
idea O 
of O 
congestion O 
pricing O 
in O 
Virginia B-LOC 
has O 
n't O 
gotten O 
past O 
the O 
talking O 
stage O 
. O 

Oh O 
yeah O 
-- O 
a O 
system O 
that O 
tracks O 
every O 
car O 
's O 
movements O 
through O 
transponders O 
will O 
go O 
over O 
with O 
the O 
public O 
in O 
Va B-LOC 
. O 

It O 
strikes O 
me O 
as O 
remarkable O 
that O 
our O 
transportation O 
policies O 
are O 
more O 
socialistic O 
than O 
Sweden B-LOC 
's O 
. O 

Anonymous B-PER 
, O 
I O 
do O 
n't O 
believe O 
that O 
the O 
Swedish O

requires O 
people O 
to O 
install O 
transponders O 
. O

By O 
all O 
accounts O 
the O 
Stockholm B-LOC 
experiment O 
has O 
been O 
a O 
success O 
, O 
so O 
far O 
. O 

First O 
, O 
Stockholm B-LOC 
spent O 
$ O 
180 O 
million O 
on O 
transportation O 
improvements O 
before O 
the O 
experiment O 
. O 

Second O 
, O 
Stockholm B-LOC 
had O 
the O 
presence O 
of O 
mind O 
and O 
the O 
fairness O 
of O 
government O 
to O 
put O 
this O 
together O 
as O 
an O 
experiment O 
, O 
and O 
allow O 
the O 
citizens O 
to O 
dismantle O 
it O 
later O 
if O 
they O 
thought O 
it O 
not O 
worthwhile O 
. O 

Where O 
is O 
the O 
referendum O 
on O 
whether O 
we O 
should O 
spend O 
umpteen O 
billion O 
on O 
the O 
Tyson B-LOC 
's O 
project O 
? O 

Third O 
, O 
granted O 
, O 
the O 
government O 
in O 
Stockholm B-LOC 
has O 
every O 
incentive O 
to O 
spin O 
this O 
in O 
a O 
good O 
light O 
, O 

In O 
London B-LOC 
, O 
it O 
took O 
quite O 
some O 
time O 
for O 
the O 
economic O 
effects O 
to O 
sort O 
themselves O 
out O 
and O 
be O 
measured O 
. O 

Although O 
the O 
London B-LOC 
experiment O 
also O 
seems O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
success O 
, O 
there O 
is O 
considerable O 
movement O 
against O 
it O 
and O 
the O 
rapid O 
rise O 
in O 
tolling O 
charges O 
that O 
followed O 
. O 

In O 
London B-LOC 
there O 
seems O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
distinct O 
decrease O 
in O 
business O 
just O 
inside O 
the O 
edge O 
of O 
the O 
congestion O 
zone O 
and O 
a O 
distinct O 
increase O 
just O 
outside O

It O 
is O 
too O 
soon O 
to O 
see O 
what O 
happens O 
in O 
Stockholm B-LOC 
, O 

Singapore B-LOC 
is O 
another O 
example O 
of O 
effective O 
use O 
of O

. O 

I O 
'm O 
not O 
usre O 
that O 
there O 
's O 
much O 
about O

we O

of O

there O 
over O 
the O 
past O 
20 O 
years O 
, O 
I O 
can O 
testify O 
that O 
traffic O 
in O 
the O

is O 
much O 
improved O 
without O 
any O

In O

there O 
are O 
at O

two O

If O

is O 
right O

then O 
some O

its O

, O 
it O 
was O 
further O 
argued O

the O

to O 
leave O

the O

It O 
is O 
a O 
fact O 
, O 
however O 
, O 
that O 
the O 
history O 
of O

is O 
, O 
for O 
many O

inextricably O 
linked O

The O 
growth O 
of O

was O 
paralleled O 
by O 
the O 
rise O 
of O 
the O

effectively O 
wiped O 
out O

when O 
the O

disgusted O 
by O 
the O

the O

the O

clustered O 
around O

Ovidie B-PER

the O

on O

`` O

Ovidie B-PER

Like O 
a O 
typical O 
Dostoievksy B-PER 
character O 
, O 
we O 
can O 
not O 
account O 
for O 
the O 
behavior O 
if O 
it O 
were O 
n't O 
for O 
an O 
apparently O 
overriding O 
need O 
to O 
confess O 
and O 
proclaim O 
-- O 
over O 
and O 
against O 
what O 
the O 
outside O 
world O 
wants O 
to O 
believe O 
-- O 
the O 
truth O 
of O 
who O 
we O 
are O 
. O 

The O 
on O 
- O 
going O 
spectacle O 
of O 
Michael B-PER 
's O 
increasingly O 
bizarre O 
conduct O 
is O 
his O 
confession O 
to O 
the O 
world O 
that O 
he O 
is O 
one O 
spectacularly O 
psychologically O 
- O 
challenged O 
dude O 
. O 

Like O 
children O 
who O 
are O 
incapable O 
of O 
dissimulating O 
their O 
basic O 
wants O 
and O 
needs O 
, O 
Michael B-PER 
's O 
manner O 
of O 
being O 
in O 
the O 
world O 
is O 
uncensored O 
and O 
spontaneous O 
, O 

The O 
facts O 
of O 
Michael B-PER 
's O 
life O 
have O 
been O 
well O 
documented O 
. O 

Not O 
only O 
was O 
the O 
song O 
's O 
momentum O 
and O 
tension O 
brilliantly O 
crafted O 
and O 
fused O 
, O 
Michael B-PER 
's O 
riveting O 
, O 
counterpoint O 
choreography O 
- O 
which O 
remains O 
unsurpassed O 
-- O 
revolutionized O 
the O 
way O 
we O 
simultaneously O 
look O 
at O 
and O 
listen O 
to O 
music O 
. O 

But O 
from O 
here O 
on O 
in O 
, O 
it O 
would O 
be O 
downhill O 
for O 
the O 
genre O 
's O 
quintessential O 
messenger O 
, O 
for O 
Michael B-PER 
could O 
no O 
longer O 
sustain O 
the O 
' O 
great O 
lie O 
' O 
he O 
was O 
living O 
. O 

To O 
this O 
single O 
end O 
, O 
Joe B-PER 
Jackson I-PER 
was O 
ruthlessly O 
single O 
- O 
minded O 
. O 

Michael B-PER 
was O 
terrified O 
of O 
him O 
, O 
whose O 
mere O 
presence O 
could O 
induce O 
nausea O 
. O 

At O 
the O 
age O 
of O 
5 O 
, O 
the O 
father O 
yanked O 
the O 
son O 
from O 
his O 
pail O 
and O 
sandbox O 
existence O 
and O 
made O 
him O 
run O 
Hollywood B-ORG 
's O 
grimmest O 
gauntlets O 
. O 

The O 
little O 
mouse O 
that O 
Michael B-PER 
was O 
suddenly O 
found O 
himself O 
in O 
the O 
rat O 
race O 
and O 
quickly O 
learned O 
to O 
hate O 
it O 
, O 

But O 
the O 
stage O 
could O 
not O 
provide O 
Michael B-PER 
with O 
immunity O 
against O 
the O 
constant O 
encroachment O 
of O 
the O 
adult O 
world O 
. O 

Michael B-PER 
was O 
announcing O 
that O 
he O 
could O 
no O 
longer O 
follow O 
the O 
course O 
Father O 
and O 
Hollywood B-ORG 
had O 
staked O 
out O 
for O 
him O 
, O 
that O 
the O 
disparity O 
between O 
his O 
real O 
self O 
and O 
the O 
role O 
he O 
was O 
thrust O 
into O 
had O 
reached O 
unsustainable O 
incommensurability O 
. O 

and O 
from O 
this O 
point O 
on O 
, O 
Michael B-PER 
would O 
reduce O 
the O 
project O 
of O 
his O 
life O 
to O 
letting O 
the O 
world O 
know O 
the O 
truth O 
of O 
who O 
he O 
was O 
: O 
a O 
confused O 
, O 
fragile O 
, O 
lost O 
soul O 
in O 
search O 
of O 
care O 
and O 
love O 
. O 

By O 
the O 
time O 
Michael B-PER 
had O 
attained O 
mythic O 
status O 
, O 
he O 
was O 
so O 
far O 
removed O 
and O 
alienated O 
from O 
himself O 
, O 
he O 
would O 
have O 
to O 
shed O 
, O 
over O 
a O 
period O 
of O 
20 O 
years O 
and O 
still O 
counting O 
, O 
one O 
skin O 
after O 
another O 
before O 
his O 
true O 
self O 
could O 
begin O 
to O 
emerge O 
. O 

Michael B-PER 
's O 
journey O 
of O 
self O 
- O 
discovery O 
is O 
a O 
work O 
in O 
progress O 
like O 
no O 
other O 
because O 
it O 
increasingly O 
depends O 
on O 
the O 
accommodation O 
of O 
two O 
irreconcilables O 
: O 
the O 
child O 
and O 
adult O 
as O 
one O 
. O 

More O 
revealing O 
of O 
itself O 
than O 
its O 
favorite O 
target O 
, O 
public O 
opinion O 
has O 
not O 
seen O 
fit O 
to O 
grant O 
Michael B-PER 
the O 
inalienable O 
right O 
to O 
his O 
confused O 
mental O 
state O 
and O 
' O 
off O 
the O 
wall O 
' O 
comportment O 
. O 

If O 
most O 
people O 
subscribe O 
to O 
the O 
notion O 
that O 
black O 
and O 
white O 
are O 
not O 
only O 
skin O 
colors O 
but O 
states O 
of O 
mind O 
, O 
why O 
are O 
we O 
baffled O 
or O 
offended O 
when O 
Michael B-PER 
, O 
who O 
was O 
introduced O 
to O 
the O 
white O 
ways O 
of O 
Hollywood B-ORG 
at O 
the O 
age O 
of O 
5 O 
, O 
tells O 
us O 
that O 
he O 
is O 
n't O 
sure O 
what O 
his O 
true O 
color O 
is O 
? O 

Robbed O 
of O 
his O 
childhood O 
, O 
abused O 
by O 
a O 
psychotic O 
father O 
and O 
then O 
prematurely O 
subjected O 
to O 
the O 
adult O 
pressures O 
of O 
the O 
entertainment O 
world O 
, O 
why O 
are O 
we O 
surprised O 
to O 
learn O 
that O 
Michael B-PER 
does O 
n't O 
want O 
to O 
grow O 
up O 
, O 
that O 
he O 
prefers O 
the O 
company O 
and O 
community O 
of O 
children O 
, O 
that O 
he O 
wants O 
to O 
be O 
protected O 
and O 
looked O 
after O 
? O 

Every O 
time O 
the O 
androgynous O 
Jackson B-PER 
goes O 
under O 
the O 
knife O 
he O 
is O 
crying O 
out O 
that O 
he O 
does O 
n't O 
know O 
if O 
he O 
is O 
man O 
or O 
woman O 
, O 
child O 
or O 
adult O 
, O 
black O 
or O 
white O 
. O 

And O 
to O 
the O 
never O 
- O 
ending O 
suspicion O 
that O 
Michael B-PER 
is O 
a O 
child O 
abuser O 
, O 
what O 
crime O 
has O 
been O 
committed O 
when O 
two O 
experimenting O 
11 O

fool O 
around O 
sexually O 
? O 

If O 
you O 
believe O 
that O 
Michael B-PER 
has O 
the O 
mentality O 
of O 
an O 
11 O 
- O 
year O 
- O 
old O 
, O 
-LRB- O 
and O 
there O 
has O

been O 
much O 
evidence O 
to O 
the O 
contrary O 
during O 
the O 
past O 
20 O 
years O 
-RRB- O 
he O 
should O 
not O 
have O 
had O 
to O 
defend O 
himself O 
against O 
accusations O 
of O 
child O 
molestation O 
. O 

More O 
questionable O 
, O 
even O 
criminal O 
, O 
than O 
Michael B-PER 
's O 
alleged O 
fooling O 
around O 
with O 
other O 
kids O 
, O 
were O 
the O 
parents O 
who O 
allowed O

even O 
encouraged O 
their O 
children O 
to O 
sleep O 
over O

perhaps O 
share O 
the O

bed O 
with O 
someone O 
whose O 
sexual O 
predilections O 
have O 
been O 
suspect O 
since O 
1991 O 
. O 

On O 
June O 
13 O 
, O 
2005 O 
, O 
the O 
courts O 
found O 
Michael B-PER 
not O 
guilty O 
of O 
the O 
charges O 
brought O 
against O 
him O

However O 
, O 
those O 
whose O 
minds O 
were O 
decided O 
on O 
his O 
guilt O 
before O 
the O 
trial O 
began O 
will O 
not O 
be O 
changed O 
by O 
the O 
verdict O 
, O 
just O 
as O 
Michael B-PER 
's O 
essential O 
nature O 
will O 
not O 
have O 
changed O 
. O 

Mahatma B-PER

that O 
' O 
There O

a O

that O 
is O 
the O 
court O 
of O 
conscience O

' O 

Only O 
Michael B-PER 
knows O 
if O 
he O 
is O 
sexually O 
attracted O 
to O 
children O

and O 
beyond O 
that O 
, O 
if O 
he O 
has O 
ever O 
acted O

if O 
we O 
grant O 
him O 
the O 
mental O 
age O 
of O 
an O 
11 O

has O

There O 
remains O 
one O

The O 
surrealistic O 
cinema O 
of O 
Luis B-PER 
Bunuel I-PER 
-- O 

by O 
Bryan B-PER 
M. I-PER 
Papciak I-PER 

`` O 
The O 
thought O 
of O 
death O 
has O 
been O 
familiar O 
to O 
me O 
for O 
a O 
long O 
time O 
, O 
'' O 
says O 
Director O 
Luis B-PER 
Bunuel I-PER 
. O 

`` O 
From O 
the O 
time O 
that O 
skeletons O 
were O 
carried O 
through O 
the O 
streets O 
of O 
Calanda B-LOC 
during O 
the O 
Holy O 
Week O 
procession O 
, O 
death O 
has O 
been O 
an O 
integral O 
part O 
of O 
my O 
life O 
. O 

Like O 
many O 
of O 
his O 
contemporary O 
surrealists O 
, O 
Bunuel B-PER 
is O 
a O 
paradox O 
who O 
on O 
one O 
hand O 
claims O 
apathy O 
towards O 
ultimate O 
end O 
, O 
being O 
, O 
and O 
Being O 
, O 
yet O 
on O 
the O 
other O 
hand O 
loads O 
his O 
impressive O 
body O 
of O 
work O 
with O 
moribund O 
imagery O 
and O 
strange O 
ideas O 
about O 
the O 
God O 
he O 
so O 
vociferously O 
denies O 
. O 

Bunuel B-PER 
exhibits O 
a O 
radical O 
, O 
iconoclastic O 
view O 
of O 
the O 
world O 
in O 
which O 
he O 
finds O 
society O 
decadent O 
and O 
antithetical O 
to O 
human O 
liberation O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
only O 
recently O 
has O 
his O 
reputation O 
in O 
America B-LOC 
begun O 
to O 
catch O 
up O 
. O 

Utilizing O 
sardonic O 
humor O 
and O 
the O 
imagery O 
of O 
surrealism O 
, O 
Bunuel B-PER 
set O 
out O 
to O 
undermine O 
the O 
values O 
and O 
institutions O 
people O 
take O 
for O 
granted O 
. O 

His O 
aims O 
were O 
specific O 
: O 
through O 
the O 
surreal O 
, O 
visualizing O 
the O 
impulses O 
of O 
the O

To O 
comprehend O 
Bunuel B-PER 
's O 
works O 
it O 
is O 
essential O 
to O 
understand O 
that O 
he O 
was O 
first O 
a O 
Spaniard O 
and O 
secondly O 
a O 
product O 
of O 
Spanish O 
bourgeoisie O

Virginia B-PER 
Higgenbotham I-PER

out O 
that O

also O

While O 
honing O 
his O 
skills O 
working O 
as O 
an O 
A.D. O 
, O 
Bunuel B-PER 
also O 
began O 
contributing O 
articles O

various O 
literary O

periodicals O 
, O 
most O 
notably O 
La B-ORG 
Gaceta I-ORG 
Hispanoamericana I-ORG 
. O 

In O 
1929 O 
he O 
formally O 
entered O 
the B-ORG 
Paris I-ORG 
Surrealist I-ORG 
Group I-ORG 
. O 

Within O 
this O 
setting O 
he O 
embarked O 
on O 
his O 
first O 
film O 
project O 
as O 
director O 
, O 
a O 
collaboration O 
with O 
his O 
residencia O 
friend O 
Salvador B-PER 
Dali I-PER

entitled O 
Un O 
Chien O

He O 
collaborated O 
with O

again O 
in O

on O

For O 
Bunuel B-PER

however O

had O 
little O 
to O 
do O 
with O 
it O

Michael B-PER 
Gould I-PER 
states O 
in O 
Surrealism O 
and O 
the O 
Cinema O 
, O 
`` O 
If O 
the O

can O 
not O 
be O

then O 
it O 
leaves O 
the O

comes O 
to O

Bunuel B-PER 
was O 
drawn O 
to O 
the O 
surrealist O 
movement O 
for O 
more O 
than O 
revolutionary O 
or O 
psychological O 
reasons O 
. O 

The O 
surreal O 
qualities O 
in O 
Bunuel B-PER 
's O 
films O 
can O 
be O 
traced O 
to O 
a O 
number O 
of O 
sources O 
, O 

Bunuel B-PER 
believed O 
that O 
his O 
own O 
form O 
of O 
atheism O 
led O 
inevitably O 
to O 
the O 
acceptance O 
of O 
the O 
inexplicable O 
. O 

The O 
surrealists O 
opposed O 
nearly O 
all O 
traditional O 
values O 
and O 
, O 
as O 
noted O 
before O 
, O 
sought O 
to O 
destroy O 
`` O 
all O 
conventional O 
social O

Yemen B-LOC 
on O 
most O 
of O 
my O

for O

poor O

they O 
have O 
started O

I O 
go O 
to O

more O

once O 
a O

In O 
order O 
for O 
the O

to O 
benefit O 
religiously O 
from O 
their O 
visits O 
to O 
Yemen B-LOC 
, O 
I O 
invite O 
them O 
to O 
visit O 
the O 
Quranic O 
houses O 
which O 
are O 
spread O 
through O 
all O 
the O

include O 
thousands O

spending O 
their O 
time O 
with O 
the O 
Holy O 
Quran O

Also O 
, O 
visiting O 
the O 
charity O 
associations O 
that O 
are O 
active O 
in O 
the O 
programs O 
they O 
provide O 
, O 
like O 
the B-ORG 
Islah I-ORG

, O 
Tiba B-ORG 
Charity I-ORG 
Foundation I-ORG 
, O 
and O 
others O

What O 
also O 
distinguishes O 
Yemen B-LOC 
is O 
the O 
diversity O 
of O 
cultures O 
. O 

It O 
has O 
coastal O 
areas O 
and O 
beaches O 
that O 
are O 
not O

like O 
the B-LOC

And O 
visiting O 
Yemen B-LOC 
does O 
not O 
cost O 
you O 
much O

where O 
is O

Four O 
years O

a O

give O 
a O 
presentation O

on O

and O 
I O 
do O 
not O 
miss O 
a O 
chance O 
to O 
talk O 
about O 
Iraq B-LOC

I O 
was O 
not O 
ready O 
for O 
another O 
defeat O 
by O 
America B-LOC 
and O 
its O 
" O 
programs O 
" O 
... O 

At O 
that O 
time O 
, O 
the O 
American O 
siege O 
was O 
killing O 
the O 
children O 
of O 
Iraq B-LOC

and O 
I O 
wanted O 
to O 
symbolically O 
take O 
revenge O 
... O 

A O 
draw O 
was O 
a O 
victory O 
for O

for O

Power O

... O 

The O 
Israeli O 
forces O 
responded O 
inhumanely O

viciously O 
against O 
south O 
Lebanon B-LOC

which O 
led O 
to O 
the O 
death O 
of O 
hundreds O 
of O 
people O

. O 

There O 
is O 
no O 
question O 
that O 
Israel B-LOC

to O 
blame O

these O 
massacres O

should O 
be O 
condemned O

Without O 
doubt O 
, O 
Israel O 
was O 
not O 
able O 
to O 
defeat O 
Hezbollah O 
militarily O

it O 
suffered O 
many O

what O 
were O

Mr. B-PER

the O 
first O

To O

that O 
the O

as O 
a O

has O 
a O 
history O

he O 
should O 
have O 
called O

avoided O 
the O 
barren O 
justification O 
that O

The O

no O

that O 
what O

An O 
Intellectual O 
who O 
was O 
a O 
Lifelong O 
Leading O 
Official O 
until O 
Death O 
-- O 
A O 
Few O 
Disrespectful O 
Words O 
about O 
Director O 
Ba B-PER 

A O 
sinecure O 
can O 
always O 
be O 
arranged O 
for O 
you O 
at O 
a O 
salary O 
high O 
enough O 
for O 
you O 
to O 
maintain O 
your O 
integrity O 
, O 
like O 
going O 
to O 
the O 
CPPCC B-ORG 
to O 
serve O 
as O 
some O 
deputy O 
chairperson O 
. O 

I O 
've O 
had O 
a O 
look O 
at O 
Director B-PER 
Ba I-PER 
's I-PER 
biography O 
and O 
was O 
surprised O 
to O 
find O 
that O 
Director B-PER 
Ba I-PER 
had O 
been O 
chairman O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Writers I-ORG 
' I-ORG 
Association I-ORG 
since O 
1983 O 
right O 
up O 
until O 
he O 
passed O 
away O 
. O 

I O 
think O 
that O 
the B-ORG 
Writers I-ORG 
' I-ORG 
Association I-ORG 
is O 
n't O 
any O 
kind O 
of O 
important O 
department O 
affecting O 
the O 
national O 
economy O 
and O 
people O 
's O 
livelihood O 
and O 
whether O 
it O 
was O 
the O 
lifelong O 
term O 
system O 
would O 
draw O 
nobody O 
's O 
attention O 
. O 

But O 
Director B-PER 
Ba I-PER 
, O 
as O 
an O 
intellectual O 
who O 
always O 
spoke O 
the O 
truth O 
and O 
stood O 
up O 
for O 
what O 
was O 
right O 
, O 
should O 
have O 
known O 
that O 
the O 
lifelong O 
term O 
system O 
of O 
leaders O 
is O 
not O 
good O 
, O 
and O 
should O 
have O 
been O 
opposed O 
. O 

Moreover O 
, O 
when O 
Director B-PER 
Ba I-PER 
became O 
chairman O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Writers I-ORG 
' I-ORG 
Association I-ORG 
, O 
he O 
was O 
already O 
quite O 
elderly O 
. O 

How O 
could O 
he O 
have O 
that O 
much O 
energy O 
to O 
manage O 
the O 
affairs O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Writers I-ORG 
' I-ORG 
Association I-ORG 
? O 

In O 
fact O 
, O 
in O 
his O 
last O 
days O 
, O 
Director B-PER 
Ba I-PER 
lay O 
in O 
the O 
hospital O 
, O 
unable O 
even O 
to O 
speak O 
, O 
completely O 
reliant O 
on O 
medical O 
intervention O 
to O 
keep O 
him O 
alive O 
. O 

" O 
Harvest O 
" O 
magazine O 
was O 
created O 
by O 
Director B-PER 
Ba I-PER 
single O 
- O 
handedly O 
, O 
and O 
he O 
was O 
always O 
its O 
chief O 
editor O 
. O 

After O 
Director B-PER 
Ba I-PER 
passed O 
away O 
, O 
the O 
magazine O 
still O 
wrote O 
that O 
he O 
was O 
the O 
chief O 
editor O 
. O 

To O 
say O 
a O 
little O 
more O 
: O 
right O 
now O 
all O 
the O

are O 
all O 
heaping O

I O

But O 
in O

both O 
in O 
the O 
past O

there O 
are O 
many O 
reversals O

the O 
natural O

thus O 
making O 
it O 
hard O 
to O 
judge O 
if O 
a O 
so O 
- O 
called O 
" O 
illegal O 
" O 
thing O 
is O 
also O 
unreasonable O 
. O 

This O 
kind O 
of O 
so O

called O

ignores O 
the O

in O 
terms O 
of O 
the O 
great O

Professor B-PER

this O

Following O

the O

has O

into O 
" O

after O 
five O 
years O 
of O 
continuous O

And O 
what O 
measures O 
will O 
China B-LOC 
take O 
in O 
response O 
? O 

The B-LOC 
United I-LOC

is O 
the O 
powerhouse O 
of O 
the O 
world O 
economy O 
and O 
the O 
largest O

. O 

The O

global O

are O

should O 
the O

experience O

Some O 
expect O 
that O

export O 
growth O 
rate O 
will O 
decrease O 
from O 
23 O 
percent O 
to O 
15 O 
percent O 
in O 
2007 O 
. O 

China B-LOC 
is O 
fully O 
capable O 
of O 
withstanding O 
the O 
impacts O 
. O 

Regardless O 
of O 
the O 
accuracy O 
of O 
various O 
comments O 
, O 
China B-LOC 
must O 
be O 
prepared O 
to O 
cope O 
with O 
the O 
US O 
economic O 
recession O 
. O 

Although O 
some O 
predictions O 
are O 
a O 
little O 
sensational O 
, O 
the O 
author O 
believes O 
the O 
US O 
economic O

this O 
time O 
will O 
not O 
be O 
very O 
severe O 
, O 
with O 
less O 
impacts O 
on O 
China B-LOC 
than O 
other O 
countries O 
. O 

From O 
the O 
current O 
situation O 
, O 
strong O 
domestic O 
investment O 
within O 
China B-LOC 
has O 
fully O 
compensated O 
the O 
impact O 
of O 
the O 
decrease O 
in O 
net O 
export O 
. O 

It O 
would O 
be O 
exaggerating O 
to O 
say O 
China B-LOC 
is O 
70 O 
percent O 
dependent O 
on O 
foreign O

. O 

The O 
statistics O 
has O

. O 

Export O 
- O

economic O

be O

while O 
the O 
role O

If O 
factors O 
such O

the O 
rapid O 
development O 
of O 
the O

and O 
the O 
appreciation O

are O 
taken O 
into O 
consideration O 
, O 
China B-LOC

dependence O 
on O 
foreign O 
trade O 
can O 
be O 
controlled O 
at O 
around O 
50 O 
percent O 
in O 
the O 
long O 
run O 
. O 

The O 
US B-LOC 
also O 
suffered O 
stock O 
market O 
crash O 
in O 
2001 O 
. O 

China B-LOC 
is O 
the O 
only O 
one O 
to O 
realize O 
economic O 
emergence O 
for O 
the O 
largest O 
population O 
in O 
the O

Whenever O 
there O 
is O 
an O 
international O 
economic O

, O 
China B-LOC 
would O 
actively O 
expand O 
domestic O 
demand O 
to O 
create O 
market O 
for O 
different O 
countries O 
. O 

In O 
fact O 
, O 
China B-LOC 
has O 
long O 
been O 
a O 
responsible O 
big O 
nation O 
, O 
playing O 
a O 
stabilizing O 
role O 
to O 
the O 
international O 
society O 
. O 

Beginning O 
2007 O 
, O 
the O 
economic O 
aggregate O 
is O 
expected O 
to O 
increase O 
sharply O 
by O 
150 O

, O 
leading O 
to O 
the O 
" O 
historical O 
disequilibrium O 
development O 
" O 
predicted O 
by O 
Soros B-PER 
. O 

This O 
is O 
also O 
why O 
China B-LOC 
is O 
not O 
afraid O 
of O 
a O 
global O 
economic O 
crisis O 
and O 
capable O 
of O 
digesting O 
it O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
after O 
2020 O 
, O 
China B-LOC 
will O 
be O 
facing O 
the O 
puzzle O 
of O 
population O 
aging O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
sure O 
to O 
witness O 
an O 
economic O 
slowdown O 
. O 

Various O 
disequilibriums O 
in O 
the O 
rapid O 
growth O 
of O 
China B-LOC 
must O 
be O

This O 
day O 
came O 
with O 
great O 
difficulty O 
for O 
China B-LOC 
. O 

Japan B-LOC 
's O 
was O 
about O 
9 O 
million O 
tons O 
. O 

The O 
important O 
thing O 
is O 
that O 
Japan B-LOC 
had O 
a O 
complete O 
industrial O 
system O 
and O 
was O 
able O 
to O 
independently O 
produce O 
all O 
its O 
weapons O 
, O 
from O 
handguns O 
to O 
aircraft O 
carriers O 
, O 
and O 
it O 
had O 
a O 
formidable O 
research O 
production O 
capacity O 
. O 

Compared O 
to O 
this O 
, O 
at O 
the O 
time O 
China B-LOC 
could O 
only O 
produce O 
rifles O 
and O 
small O 
cannon O 
; O 
its O 
capacity O 
to O 
produce O 
heavy O 
weapons O 
was O 
zero O 
. O 

This O 
means O 
that O 
China B-LOC 
's O 
consumption O 
could O 
not O 
be O 
met O 
. O 

The O 
most O 
obvious O 
part O 
of O 
China B-LOC 
's O 
being O 
a O 
big O 
country O 
was O 
its O 
population O 
advantage O 
. O 

The O 
important O 
thing O 
is O 
that O 
Japan B-LOC 
had O 
a O 
complete O 
reserve O

, O 
with O 
more O 
than O 
four O 
million O

who O 
had O 
received O 
basic O 
military O

China B-LOC 
had O 
basically O 
no O 
reserve O 
military O 
personnel O

and O 
the O 
" O 
national O 
army O

relied O 
primarily O 
on O 
seizing O 
able O 
- O

men O 
to O 
fill O 
its O 
ranks O

What O 
was O 
even O 
more O 
disheartening O 
was O 
China B-LOC

disintegration O 
: O

their O 
military O

, O 
China B-LOC

taking O

was O

Everybody O

their O 
own O 
reasons O 
for O 
choosing O 
a O 
university O 
; O 
because O 
the O 
cost O

, O 
and O 
I O 
did O

my O

all O

money O 
, O 
I O 
chose O 
the B-ORG 
University I-ORG

Science I-ORG

Technology I-ORG 
of I-ORG 
China I-ORG 
. O 

Perhaps O 
if O 
I O 
'd O 
chosen O 
two O 
schools O 
in O 
Beijing B-LOC 
, O 
I O 
would O 
n't O 
be O 
here O 
today O 
talking O 
about O 
how O 
USTC B-ORG 
is O 
. O 

But O 
USTC B-ORG 
at O 
the O 
time O 
was O 
weak O 
; O 
considering O 
location O 
, O 
expenses O 
, O 
promotion O 
and O 
connections O 
, O 
USTC B-ORG 
's O 
greatest O 
wealth O 
was O 
its O 
students O 
. O 

If O 
we O 
had O 
n't O 
come O 
forward O 
and O 
done O 
something O 
for O 
USTC B-ORG 
, O 
it O 
would O 
have O 
been O 
finished O 
. O 

This O 
is O 
also O 
the O 
main O 
reason O 
USTC B-ORG 
students O 
banded O 
together O 
. O 

Because O 
I O 
chose O 
science O 
and O 
technology O 
as O 
my O 
career O 
, O 
I O 
am O 
grateful O 
to O 
USTC B-ORG

teaching O 
me O 
many O 
things O

and O 
I O 
am O

the O

previous O

who O 
enabled O

who O 
came O

it O

Precisely O 
because O 
I O 
feel O 
this O 
gratitude O

I O 
want O 
to O 
repay O 
USTC B-ORG

I O 
regularly O 
do O 
my O 
job O 
properly O 
and O 
do O 
not O 
let O

I O

I O

When O 
I O

I O 
sometimes O 
want O

take O 
the O

it O

even O 
though O 
that O

Those O

I O

Tutu B-PER

I O

a O

I O 
lit O 
some O

the O 
two O 
of O 
us O

When O 
Zhang B-PER

grew O 
up O

he O 
liked O 
to O 
eat O 
, O 
was O 
lazy O

and O 
he O 
often O 
went O 
gambling O

so O 
the O 
old O 
husband O

wife O 
decided O 
to O 
marry O 
him O 
off O

let O 
their O

They O 
sent O

a O

When O

did O 
he O

he O 
thought O

Later O 
the B-PER 
Jade I-PER 
Emperor I-PER 
made O 
him O

put O 
him O

. O 

I O 
even O 
do O 
n't O 
know O 
why O 
these O 
two O 
organizations O 
are O 
not O 
a O 
single O

- O 
Judging O 
from O 
the O 
name O 
, O 
it O 
seems O 
that O

Bureau I-ORG 
could O 
be O 
a O 
division O 
of O

definitely O 
. O 

Before O 
we O 
fully O 
undertook O 
C3CRM O

we O 
had O 
always O 
felt O 
that O 
we O 
would O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
survive O 
in O 
China B-LOC

offering O 
technical O

So O 
it O 
is O 
currently O 
very O 
difficult O 
to O 
rely O

in O

. O 

Chairman O 
Pei B-PER 
of O 
shopex B-ORG 
feels O 
the O 
same O 
way O 
. O 

At O 
first O 
, O 
I O 
signed O 
up O 
for O 
a O 
blog O 
on O 
DONEWS B-ORG 
, O 
thinking O 
that O 
it O 
was O 
a O 
site O 
for O 
IT O 
professionals O 
where O 
I O 
could O 
perhaps O 
find O 
friends O 
more O 
easily O 
. O 

Later O 
, O 
I O 
signed O 
up O 
for O 
another O 
one O 
on O 
MSN B-ORG 
, O 
feeling O 
that O 
writing O 
on O 
MSN B-ORG 
might O 
make O 
it O 
easier O 
for O 
me O 
to O 
communicate O 
directly O 
with O 
my O 
MSN B-ORG 
pals O 
. O 

At O 
that O 
time O 
, O 
DONEWS B-ORG 
did O 
not O 
have O 
the O 
function O 
of O 
tallying O 
traffic O 
statistics O 
-LRB- O 
I O 
have O 
the O 
habit O 
of O 
looking O 
at O 
the O 
statistics O 
of O 
everything O 
-RRB- O 
; O 
and O 
even O 
though O 
MSN B-ORG 
had O 
that O 
function O 
, O 
others O 
needed O 
to O 
sign O 
on O 
to O 
MSN B-ORG 
before O 
they O 
could O 
reply O 
, O 
this O 
meant O 
that O 
after O 
reading O 
the O 
entries O 
, O 
many O 
could O 
not O 
reply O 
even O 
if O 
they O 
wanted O 
to O 
, O 
hence O 
largely O 
reducing O 
the O 
interactive O 
element O 
. O 

Later O 
, O 
there O 
were O 
also O 
some O 
minor O 
problems O 
with O 
both O 
MSN B-ORG 
and O 
DONEWS B-ORG 
, O 
so O 
I O 
became O 
more O 
unwilling O 
to O 
post O 
new O 
articles O

Desmond B-PER

stressed O 
one O 
little O

known O 
factor O

bacteria O 
. O 

In O 
1618 O 
Mexico B-LOC

twenty O 
million O

reduced O 
to O 
1.6 O 
million O

to O 
the O

Desmond B-PER 
did O 
not O 
attribute O 
bacteria O 
to O 
the O 
human O 
species O 
, O 
but O 
believed O 
that O 
they O 
, O 
together O 
with O

, O 
directly O

at O 
the O

Only O

back O 
at O

it O 
can O 
be O 
found O 
that O

more O

more O

At O 
a O

this O 
afternoon O 
, O 
new O 
immigration O

confirmed O 
by O 
Immigration O

David B-PER 
Cunliffe I-PER 
will O

use O 
biometric O

of O 
non-New O

These O 
new O

are O 
very O 
similar O

The O 
new O

it O

Cunliffe B-PER 
said O 
the O 
new O

will O 
effectively O 
simplify O

In O 
New B-LOC 
Westminster I-LOC 
, O 
a O 
homicide O 
occurred O 
yesterday O 
in O 
an O 
apartment O 
where O 
many O 
Chinese O 
reside O 
, O 

A O 
youth O 
in O 
his O 
20s O 
was O 
suspected O 
to O 
have O 
been O 
seriously O 
attacked O 
after O 
he O 
left O 
a O

he O 
was O 
found O 
lying O 
in O 
one O

the O

, O 
and O 
was O 
pronounced O 
dead O 
upon O

After O 
the O 
event O 
, O 
two O 
men O 
were O 
detained O 
by O 
the O 
police O 
to O 
assist O 
in O 
the O 
investigations O 
, O 
the O 
motive O 
of O 
the O 
murder O 
remains O 
unclear O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
case O 
is O 
now O 
referred O 
to O 
the B-ORG 
Provincial I-ORG 
Integrated I-ORG

Team I-ORG 
, O 
Dale B-PER 
Carr I-PER 
, O 
the O 
crime O 
scene O 
was O 
in O 
an O

unit O 
on O 
the O 
800 O 
block O 
of O 
Agnes B-LOC

-LRB- O 
Agnes B-LOC

-RRB- O 
in O 
New B-LOC 
Westminster I-LOC 
. O 

When O 
the O 
police O 
arrived O 
at O 
the O 
scene O 
, O 
they O 
found O 
an O 
injured O 
man O 
lying O 
in O 
the O 
unit O 
; O 
he O 
was O 
seriously O 
wounded O 
, O 
and O 
certified O 
dead O 
upon O 
arrival O 
at O 
the B-LOC 
hospital I-LOC 
. O 

Carr B-PER 
also O 
said O 
that O 
the O 
police O 
had O 
applied O 
for O 
a O 
search O 
warrant O 
from O 
the O 
court O 
yesterday O 
morning O 
, O 
and O 
entered O 
the O 
unit O 
in O 
the O 
afternoon O 
with O 
the O 
warrant O 
for O 
a O 
detailed O 
investigation O 
, O 
in O 
order O 
to O 
understand O 
more O 
about O 
the O 
incident O 
. O 

Investigators O 
from O 
the B-ORG 
Identification I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
also O 
went O 
to O 
collect O 
information O 
from O 
the O 
scene O 
later O 
, O 

The O 
company O 
that O 
I O 
previously O 
worked O 
at O 
in O 
Beijing B-LOC 
encouraged O 
employees O 
to O 
take O 
the O 
test O 
for O 
their O 
drivers O 
' O 
licenses O 
. O 

I O 
did O 
n't O 
take O 
a O 
road O 
test O 
in O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
either O 
so O 
I O 
'm O 
not O 
clear O 
how O 
it O 
's O 
actually O 
done O 
. O 

But O 
in O 
these O 
last O 
couple O 
of O 
days O 
I O 
have O 
read O 
articles O 
about O 
road O 
tests O 
posted O 
by O 
other O 
people O 
and O 
I O 
sensed O 
that O 
the O 
test O 
in O 
the B-LOC 
United I-LOC 
States I-LOC 
was O 
primarily O 
to O 
test O 
for O 
safety O 
awareness O 
, O 

I O 
think O 
the O 
high O 
requirements O 
placed O 
in O 
mainland O 
China B-LOC 
on O 
the O 
driver O 
's O 
technical O 
skills O 
are O 
due O 
to O 
the O 
large O 
number O 
of O 
people O 
who O 
do O 
not O 
observe O 
regulations O 
. O 

I O 
think O 
that O 
sometimes O 
it O 
is O 
not O 
a O 
bad O 
thing O 
to O 
be O 
ticketed O 
by O 
Uncle B-ORG 
Policeman I-ORG 
. O 

Tmac B-PER 
's O 
problem O 
is O 
actually O 
very O 
simple O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
: O 
do O 
n't O 
be O 
selfish O 
, O 
be O 
motivated O 
. O 

Yesterday O 
KB B-PER 
shot O 
26 O 
times O 
, O 
and O 
he O 
's O 
just O 
had O 
a O 
knee O 
surgery O 
this O 
summer O 
. O 

Tmac B-PER 
gets O 
the O 
highest O 
salary O 
in O 
the O 
team O 
, O 
so O 
he O 
should O 
n't O 
care O 
too O 
much O 
about O 
himself O 
. O 

If O 
he O 
's O 
like O 
what O 
he O 
is O 
doing O 
right O 
now O 
-- O 
neither O 
willing O 
to O 
break O 
through O 
at O 
the O 
risk O 
of O 
being O 
injured O 
, O 
nor O 
willing O 
to O 
take O 
the O 
responsibility O 
of O 
the O 
last O 
shot O 
on O 
his O 
own O 
shoulders O 
like O 
a O 
real O 
leader O 
of O 
the O 
team O 
-- O 
then O 
we O 
get O 
the O 
Tmac B-PER 
we O 
've O 
got O 
now O 
, O 
and O 
we O 
might O 
hate O 
what O 
's O 
happened O 
to O 
him O 
, O 
but O 
we O 
're O 
angry O 
that O 
he O 
's O 
not O 
fighting O 
back O

Evening O 
Spectacular O 

After O 
watching O 
the O 
New O 
Year O 
's O 
Spectacular O 
held O 
by O 
NTD B-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
, O 
I O 
had O 
a O 
feeling O 
that O 
I O 
have O 
n't O 
had O 
for O 
a O 
long O 
time O 
, O 

However O 
, O 
I O 
took O 
in O 
NTD B-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
's I-ORG 
Chinese O 
New O 
Year O 
Spectacular O 
as O 
a O 
friend O 
had O 
suggested O 
and O 
my O 
literary O 
and O 
art O 
cells O 
sprung O 
immediately O 
and O 
unexpectedly O 
back O 
to O 
life O 
. O 

Darwin B-PER 
proposed O 
Evolution O 
Theory O 
, O 
but O 
it O 
was O 
just O 
a O 
theory O 
, O 
and O 
he O 
himself O 
also O 
admitted O 
that O 
there O 
were O 
many O 
questions O 
, O 

But O 
as O 
the O 
originator O 
, O 
Darwin B-PER 
deserves O 
much O 
credit O 
. O 

God B-PER 
creates O 
everything O 
, O 
understands O 
everything O 
, O 
predicts O 
the O 
future O 
, O 
and O 
is O 
infinitely O 
resourceful O 
, O 
so O 
how O 
can O 
he O 
be O 
wrong O 
! O 

Therefore O 
, O 
if O 
you O 
find O 
a O 
sentence O 
that O 
is O 
allegedly O 
said O 
by O 
God B-PER 
, O 
but O 
effectively O 
turns O 
out O 
to O 
be O 
wrong O 
, O 
then O 
this O 
god O 
will O 
be O 
overthrown O 
. O 

It O 
is O 
just O 
like O 
Grandma B-PER 
Liu I-PER 
wanting O 
to O 
eat O 
quail O 
eggs O 
. O 

-LRB- O 
Grandma B-PER 
Liu I-PER 
picked O 
up O 
the O 
chopsticks O 
, O 
only O 
felt O 
that O 
she O 
could O 
not O 
master O 
it O 
, O 
so O 
she O 
said O 
, O 
" O 
The O 
chickens O 
here O 
are O 
so O 
handsome O 
, O 
they O 
also O 
lay O 
such O 
small O 
eggs O 
, O 
which O 
are O 
pretty O 
handsome O 
. O 

This B-PER 
Grandma I-PER 
Liu I-PER 
was O 
really O 
straightforward O 
yet O 
humorous O 
. O 
-RRB- O 

People O 
often O 
use O 
the O 
expression O 
" O 
three O 
longs O 
and O 
two O

" O 
to O 
symbolize O 
unpredictable O 
changes O 
; O 
for O 
instance O 
, O 
Sister B-PER 
Feng I-PER 
once O 
said O 
: O 
" O 
Just O 
as O 
there O 
could O 
be O 
unpredicted O 
winds O 
and O 
clouds O 
in O 
the O 
sky O 
, O 
people O 
too O 
can O 
experience O 
misfortunes O 
and O 
fortunes O 
at O 
any O 
time O 
. O 

Song B-PER 
Jiang I-PER 
's O

was O 
not O 
that O 
awe O

inspiring O 
. O 

It O 
seems O 
it O 
was O 
quelled O 
by O

Back O

there O

But O 
then O 
one O 
day O 
I O 
heard O 
the O 
song O 
" O 
Rainy O

" O 
and O 
could O 
n't O 
believe O 
that O 
this O

a O 
Blue B-ORG

song O 
where O 
they O 
lay O 
down O

After O

collapse O 
of O 
Saddam B-PER 
Hussein I-PER 
's I-PER 
dictatorial O 
regime O 
, O 
Iraqi O

Although O 
the O 
distribution O

of O 
the O 
new O

generally O

In O 
the O 
1950s O 
in O

its O 
military O

In O 
February O 
1969 O 
, O 
Arafat B-PER 
began O 
to O 
serve O 
as O 
the O 
chairman O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
PLO I-ORG 
Executive I-ORG 
Committee I-ORG 
and O 
since O 
1971 O 
had O 
concurrently O 
served O

the O 
commander O

chief O 
of O 
the B-ORG

In O 
November O 
1988 O 
the B-ORG 
Palestinian I-ORG 
National I-ORG

passed O 
the O 
Declaration O 
of O

special O 
19th O 
meeting O 
, O 
announcing O 
the O 
establishment O 
of O 
the O 
State O

On O 
April O 
2 O 
of O 
the O 
following O 
year O 
, O 
Arafat B-PER 
was O 
elected O 
the O 
president O 
of O 
the O 
State O 
of O 
Palestine O 
. O 

Since O 
then O 
, O 
Arafat B-PER 
had O 
appeared O 
on O 
the O 
international O 
political O 
stage O 
as O 
a O 
symbol O 
of O 
the O 
Palestinian O 
nation O 
. O 

In O 
1991 O 
, O 
the O 
Middle B-LOC 
East I-LOC 
peace O 
process O 
started O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
Arafat B-PER 
- O 
led O 
PLO B-ORG 
carried O 
out O 
tough O 
negotiations O 
with O 
Israel B-LOC 
. O 

Two O 
hundred O 
and O 
fifteen O 
innocents O 
were O 
killed O 
in O 
Baghdad B-LOC 
, O 
with O 
their O 
limbs O 
flown O 
everywhere O 
and O 
flesh O 
all O 
over O 
the O 
bloody O 
ground O 
. O 

This O 
results O 
in O 
the O 
biggest O 
death O 
toll O 
since O 
the O 
deposing O 
of O 
Saddam B-PER 
. O 

Bush B-PER 
, O 
who O 
ca O 
n't O 
even O 
protect O 
himself O 
, O 
has O 
long O 
given O 
up O 
his O 
cowboy O 
act O 
. O 

I O 
do O 
n't O 
know O 
what O 
the O 
Iraqi B-LOC 
authorities O 
, O 
who O 
are O 
struggling O 
hard O 
to O 
survive O 
, O 
are O 
going O 
to O 
think O 
. O 

But O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
participants O 
of O 
the O 
summit O 
is O 
unexpectedly O 
none O 
other O 
than O 
the O 
mortal O 
enemy O 
of O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
. O 

There O 
came O 
the O 
news O 
of O 
an O 
explosion O 
at O 
Moscow B-LOC 
University I-LOC 
. O 

Putin B-PER 
was O 
already O 
feeling O 
down O 
and O 
upset O 
. O 

They O 
've O 
gone O 
on O 
to O 
call O 
Putin B-PER 
" O 
a O 
cold O 
war O 
schemer O 
. O 
" O 

The O 
handsome O 
and O 
cool O 
- O 
styled O 
Putin B-PER 
has O 
become O 
furious O 
, O 
with O 
the O 
Russian O 
government O 
issuing O 
a O 
very O 
strongly O 
worded O 
denial O 
as O 
well O 
. O 

In O 
merely O 
two O 
short O 
years O 
, O 
this O 
minister O 
is O 
the O 
fifth O 
senior O 
official O 
to O 
be O 
assassinated O 
; O 
this O 
shows O 
that O 
even O 
after O 
the O 
forced O 
withdrawal O 
of O 
Israeli O 
troops O 
, O 
long O 
- O 
suffering O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
still O 
has O 
n't O 
ushered O 
in O 
the O 
peace O 
that O 
it O 
hoped O 
for O 
yet O 
. O 

Fortunately O 
President O 
Hu B-PER 
was O 
magnanimous O 
enough O 
not O 
to O 
take O 
it O 
to O 
heart O 
, O 
and O 
gave O 
him O 
the O 
honor O 
of O 
a O 
15 O 
- O 
minute O 
meeting O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
when O 
this O 
fellow O 
returned O 
to O 
his O 
own O 
country O 
, O 
he O 
boasted O 
recklessly O 
by O 
saying O 
that O 
his O 
meeting O 
with O 
President O 
Hu B-PER 
had O 
" O 
important O 
historical O 
significance O 
, O 
" O 
and O 
even O 
exaggerated O 
by O 
claiming O 
it O 
as O 
his O 
" O 
major O 
diplomatic O 
achievement O 
. O 
" O 

The O 
cause O 
is O 
said O 
to O 
be O 
that O 
a O 
French O 
judge O 
issued O 
an O 
international O 
warrant O 
for O 
the O 
arrest O 
of O 
nine O 
important O 
members O 
of O 
the O 
Rwandan O 
government O 
on O 
the O 
charge O 
that O 
they O 
participated O 
in O 
the O 
assassination O 
of O 
Rwanda B-LOC 
's O 
former O 
president O 
twelve O 
years O 
before O 
. O 

It O 
is O 
simply O 
that O 
the O 
families O 
of O 
the O 
French O 
flight O 
crew O 
have O 
brought O 
the O 
case O 
to O 
the O 
court O 
in O 
France B-LOC 
when O 
the O 
former O 
president O 
was O 
killed O 
and O 
thus O 
, O 
that O 
judge O 
and O 
the O 
government O 
want O 
to O 
hold O 
their O 
own O 
law O 
over O 
the O 
heads O 
of O 
others O 
. O 

Since O 
China B-LOC 
had O 
already O 
taken O 
itself O 
to O 
this O 
step O 
, O 
it O 
would O 
n't O 
seem O 
possible O 
to O 
not O 
be O 
in O 
the O 
international O 
media O 
headlines O 
if O 
it O 
ever O 
wishes O 
not O 
to O 
. O 

First O 
Cambiasso B-PER 
was O 
injured O 
. O 

Now O 
he O 
's O 
back O 
, O 
yet O 
Cruz B-PER 
has O 
gone O 
for O 
treatment O 
. O 

And O 
do O 
n't O 
even O 
start O 
on O 
Boba B-PER 
; O 
he O 
's O 
always O 
injured O 
. O 

Now O 
if O 
Inter B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
formed O 
a O 
second O 
team O 
of O 
a O 
lineup O 
, O 
it O 
would O 
be O 
also O 
very O 
strong O 
indeed O 
. O 

Tonight O 
they O 
're O 
playing O 
Lisbon B-PER 
, O 
and O 
I O 
expect O 
I O 
will O 
get O 
up O 
and O 
watch O 
the O 
game O 
. O 

The O 
reason O 
they O 
lost O 
to O 
Lisbon B-LOC 
in O 
the O 
first O 
leg O 
was O 
actually O 
still O 
that O 
Inter B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
were O 
too O 
arrogant O 
. O 

I O 
do O 
n't O 
think O 
Mancini B-PER 
will O 
have O 
failed O 
to O 
understand O 
the O 
importance O 
of O 
this O 
match O 
. O 

It O 
has O 
been O 
almost O 
ten O 
years O 
from O 
the O 
first O 
time O 
I O 
got O 
to O 
know O 
about O 
Inter B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
from O 
the O 
newspaper O 
, O 
and O 
then O 
later O 
I O 
grew O 
to O 
like O 
Inter B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
and O 
to O 
the O 
time O 
when O 
I O 
fell O 
deeply O 
in O 
love O 
with O 
Inter B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
. O 

Actually O 
, O 
Inter B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
has O 
n't O 
achieved O 
overly O 
spectacular O 
results O 
in O 
the O 
last O 
ten O 
years O 
. O 

These O 
achievements O 
simply O 
are O 
n't O 
worth O 
mentioning O 
when O 
compared O 
with O 
those O 
of O 
powerhouses O 
such O 
as O 
Manchester B-ORG 
United I-ORG 
and O 
Real B-ORG 
Madrid I-ORG 
. O 

Even O 
within O 
Italy O 
, O 
their O 
records O 
are O 
quite O 
far O 
behind O 
Juventus B-ORG 
and O 
AC B-ORG 
. O 

Then O 
why O 
do O 
I O 
still O 
like O 
Inter B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
? O 

Inter B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
's O 
just O 
a O 
step O 
away O 
from O 
the O 
championship O 
for O 
years O 
and O 
its O 
long O 
humiliation O 
by O 
Juventus B-ORG 
and O 
AC B-ORG 
stirred O 
a O 
sense O 
of O 
sympathy O 
in O 
me O 
; O 

Secondly O 
, O 
I O 
found O 
Inter B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
's I-ORG 
blue O 
and O 
black O 
jerseys O 
look O 
very O 
comfortable O 
to O 
me O 
visually O 
. O 

Gradually O 
, O 
I O 
was O 
moved O 
by O 
the O 
persistence O 
of O 
Inter B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
's I-ORG 
chairman O 
Mr. B-PER 
Moratti I-PER 
. O 

Although O 
the O 
payoff O 
has O 
been O 
small O 
after O 
decades O 
of O 
persistent O 
investment O 
, O 
that O 
does O 
n't O 
change O 
his O 
absolute O 
sincerity O 
toward O 
Inter B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
. O 

More O 
than O 
half O 
of O 
the O 
UEFA B-ORG 
Champions I-ORG 
League I-ORG 
games O 
have O 
already O 
taken O 
place O 
, O 
and O 
basically O 
many O 
strong O 
teams O 
are O 
guaranteed O 
access O 
to O 
the O 
elimination O 
series O 
. O 

Although O 
the O 
focus O 
of O 
this O 
round O 
is O 
on O 
the O 
match O 
between O 
Basa B-ORG 
and O 
Chelsea B-ORG 
, O 
there O 
is O 
little O 
doubt O 
that O 
they O 
would O 
jointly O 
enter O 
the O 
quarter O 
- O 
finals O 
. O 

But O 
the O 
situation O 
is O 
very O 
complicated O 
in O 
Group B-ORG 
B I-ORG 
; O 
if O 
Bayern B-ORG 
does O 
its O 
best O 
and O 
judging O 
by O 
their O 
abilities O 
, O 
they O 
should O 
entirely O 
demolish O 
the B-ORG 
Sporting I-ORG 
Lisbon I-ORG 
. O 

Internazionale B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
has O 
lost O 
the O 
previous O 
two O 
matches O 
to O 
the O 
opponents O 
, O 
but O 
now O 
they O 
have O 
finally O 
began O 
to O 
explode O 
; O 
it O 
remains O 
to O 
be O 
seen O 
if O 
such O 
an O 
explosion O 
would O 
be O 
too O 
late O 
. O 

On O 
the O 
4th O 
day O 
of O 
the O 
matches O 
, O 
Internazionale B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
would O 
be O 
in O 
freezing O 
- O 
cold O 
Moscow B-LOC 
; O 
Spartak B-ORG 
is O 
the O 
only O 
team O 
that O 
uses O 
artificial O 
turf O 
, O 
and O 
it O 
will O 
be O 
a O 
great O 
test O 
for O 
the B-ORG 
Internazionale I-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
. O 

Inter B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
is O 
without O 
its O 
four O 
key O 
players O 
, O 
Cambiasso B-PER 
, O 
Recoba B-PER 
, O 
Adriano B-PER 
, O 
and O 
Vieira B-PER 
. O 

With O 
the O 
absence O 
of O 
these O 
four O 
players O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
estimated O 
that O 
Internazionale B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
might O 
be O 
significantly O 
affected O 
. O 

Both O 
the B-ORG 
English I-ORG 
Super I-ORG 
and O 
Italy O 
's O 
Serie B-ORG 
A I-ORG 
have O 
their O 
advantages O 
to O 
some O 
extent O 
; O 
but O 
Italy O 
's O 
Serie B-ORG 
A I-ORG 
play O 
two O 
games O 
within O 
a O 
week O 
, O 
and O 
this O 
would O 
put O 
their O 
physical O 
abilities O 
to O 
the O 
test O 
. O 

Especially O 
for O 
the B-ORG 
Internazionale I-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
, O 
who O 
exerted O 
tremendous O 
effort O 
in O 
trying O 
to O 
win O 
the O 
big O 
game O 
against O 
AC B-ORG 
Milan I-ORG 
in O 
the O 
Derby O 
war O 
; O 
now O 
they O 
must O 
be O 
mentally O 
and O 
physically O 
exhausted O 
after O 
they O 
arrived O 
in O 
Moscow B-LOC 

Everyone O 
knows O 
North B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
is O 
poor O 
. O 

Every O 
year O 
China B-LOC 
assists O 
with O 
such O 
a O 
great O 
amount O 
of O 
grain O 
, O 
crude O 
oil O 
, O 
and O 
so O 
many O 
light O 
industrial O 
products O 
. O 

But O 
for O 
North B-LOC 
Korean I-LOC 
athletes O 
, O 
although O 
every O 
one O 
of O 
them O 
looks O 
very O 
skinny O 
, O 
their O 
energy O 
is O 
no O 
less O 
than O 
that O 
of O 
our O 
athletes O 
, O 
who O 
are O 
provided O 
with O 
three O 
scientifically O 
formulated O 
meals O 
a O 
day O

Looking O 
at O 
the O 
speed O 
and O 
fight O 
of O 
the O 
North B-LOC 
Korean I-LOC 
girls O 
, O 
I O 
basically O 
already O 
know O 
the O 
outcome O 
of O 
this O 
match O 
. O 

I O 
have O 
been O 
thinking O 
about O 
what O 
makes O 
North B-LOC 
Korean I-LOC 
athletes O 
so O 
full O 
of O 
energy O 
, O 

Though O 
each O 
of O 
them O 
looks O 
sallow O 
, O 
when O 
in O 
a O 
real O 
fight O 
, O 
let O 
alone O 
China B-LOC 
, O 
they O 
are O 
even O 
no O 
less O 
strong O

physically O

than O 
the O 
European O 
teams O

After O 
entering O 
into O 
the O 
WTO B-ORG 
, O 
we O 
frequently O 
see O 
that O 
the O 
viewpoint O 
of O 
reporters O 
when O 
criticizing O 
domestic O 
banks O 
is O 
: O 
When O 
the O 
foreign O 
- O 
funded O 
banks O 
arrive O 
later O 
on O 
, O 
if O 
your O 
service O 
attitude O 
does O 
n't O 
improve O 
a O 
bit O 
, O 
I O 
will O 
take O 
my O 
money O 
and O 
deposit O 
it O 
in O 
a O 
foreign O

In O 
a O 
unique O 
way O 
, O 
a O 
young O 
Saudi O 
woman O 
has O 
resorted O 
to O 
issuing O 
a O 
sound O 
tape O 
in O 
which O 
she O 
mourns O 
her O 
brother O 
murdered O 
in O 
Hafr B-LOC 
Al I-LOC 
Batin I-LOC 
, O 
in O 
the O 
hope O 
of O 
rekindling O 
interest O 
in O 
his O 
case O 
, O 
in O 
which O 
3 O 
young O 
men O 
were O 
accused O 
of O 
killing O 
him O 
and O 
which O 
has O 
not O 
so O 
far O 
been O 
resolved O 
. O 

The O 
details O 
of O 
the O 
case O 
go O 
back O 
4 O 
years O 
to O 
the O 
time O

It O 
claimed O

, O 
especially O 
the O 
representative O

apparently O 
was O 
the O 
one O 
who O

The O

left O

that O 
day O 
and O 
that O 
was O 
the O 
last O

we O 
saw O

At O

A. O 
H. O 
, O

of O 
the O 
head O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
General I-ORG 
Investigation I-ORG

Prosecution I-ORG 
Authority I-ORG 
called O 
me O 
and O 
told O 
me O 
that O 
the O 
head O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
General I-ORG 
Investigation I-ORG 
and I-ORG 
Prosecution I-ORG 
Authority I-ORG 
and O 
the O 
Authority B-ORG 
's O 
committee O 
had O 
fired O 
me O 
from O 
my O 
job O 
and O 
had O 
issued O 
that O 
decision O 
on O 
the O 
basis O 
of O 
the O 
following O 
two O 
reasons O 
: O 

It O 
mentioned O 
that O 
it O 
was O 
based O 
on O 
the O 
letter O 
of O 
the O 
governor O 
of O 
the O 
area O 
of O 
Riyadh B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
that O 
it O 
was O 
appropriate O 
that O 
I O 
submit O 
to O 
the O 
head O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
General I-ORG 
Investigation I-ORG 
and I-ORG 
Prosecution I-ORG 
Authority I-ORG 
my O 
letter O 
of O 
resignation O 
so O 
that O 
my O 
reputation O 
would O 
not O 
be O 
tarnished O 
by O 
that O 
decision O 
and O 
so O 
that O 
I O 
would O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
work O 
in O 
my O 
field O 
, O 
because O 
that O 
decision O 
would O 
bar O 
me O 
from O 
employment O 
in O 
the O 
future O 
. O 

So O 
I O 
traveled O 
to O 
Riyadh B-LOC 
and O 
refused O 
to O 
submit O 
my O 
resignation O 
because O 
this O 
would O 
be O 
submitting O 
to O 
injustice O 
and O 
arbitrariness O 
no O 
matter O 
what O 
the O 
consequences O 
. O 

He O 
told O 
us O 
: O 
-LRB- O 
If O 
you O 
want O 
to O 
leave O 
the O 
job O 
then O 
Farraj B-PER 
's O 
job O 
is O 
with O 
me O 
, O 
and O 
you O 
will O 
be O 
held O 
against O 
me O 
. O 
-RRB- O 

So O 
we O 
submitted O 
a O 
letter O 
to O 
the O 
governor O 
of O 
Riyadh B-LOC 
in O 
which O 
we O 
contested O 
the O 
committee O 
and O 
its O 
decision O 
, O 
and O 
we O 
explained O 
the O 
reasons O 
for O 
that O 
. O 

and O 
Salman B-PER 
has O 
not O 
responded O 
to O 
our O 
request O 
to O 
" O 
halt O 
the O 
decision O 
of O 
dismissal O 
" O 
until O 
the O 
case O 
is O 
finally O 
over O 
. O 

Then O 
the O 
head O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
General I-ORG 
Investigation I-ORG 
and I-ORG 
Prosecution I-ORG 
Authority I-ORG 
submitted O 
the O 
decision O 
of O 
my O 
dismissal O 
-LRB- O 
for O 
my O 
incompetence O 
during O 
the O 
year O 
of O 
my O 
tribulation O 
and O 
for O 
my O 
lack O 
of O 
confidence O 
and O 
respect O 
-RRB- O 
to O 
the B-ORG 
ministry I-ORG 
of I-ORG 
the I-ORG

to O 
get O 
approval O 
for O 
it O 
while O 
he O 
had O 
promised O 
us O 
to O 
reconsider O 
the O 
decision O 
of O 
dismissal O 
and O 
that O 
the O 
issue O 
was O 
still O 
with O 
the O 
committee O 
. O 

So O 
we O 
submitted O 
a O 
letter O 
to O 
the B-PER 
minister I-PER 
of I-PER 
the I-PER 
interior I-PER 
-LRB- O 
a O

we O 
explained O 
that O 
the O 
decision O 
of O

violates O 
the O

justice O

and O 
the O 
truth O 
since O 
my O 
alleged O 
incompetence O 
during O 
the O 
period O 
of O

was O 
answered O 
and O 
refuted O 
by O 
the O

I O 
received O 
the O

The O

the O 
head O 
of O 
the O 
Authority B-ORG 
with O 
disapproval O 
of O 
the O 
decision O 
of O 
dismissal O 
because O 
of O 
its O 
violation O 
of O 
the O 
regulation O 
. O 

When O 
checking O 
back O 
with O 
the O 
head O 
of O 
the O 
Authority B-ORG 
he O 
promised O 
something O 
good O 
. O 

It O 
became O 
clear O 
that O 
he O 
returned O 
the O 
proceedings O 
secretly O 
to O 
the B-PER 
minister I-PER

the I-PER

requesting O

It O 
was O

that O 
the O

returned O 
to O 
him O

And O 
that O 
he O 
justified O 
his O

of O 
the O 
previous O 
instruction O 
on O 
the O 
invalidity O 
of O 
the O 
decision O

which O 
was O 
according O 
to O 
the O 
instruction O 
of O 
the O 
governor O

and O 
his O 
insistence O 
on O 
my O

It O 
turned O 
out O 
that O 
the O

the O

Do O 
n't O 
you O 
agree O 
with O 
me O 
that O 
the O 
Safavid O 
Rafida B-PER 
revealed O 
to O 
the O 
world O 
their O 
stupidity O 
when O 
they O 
showed O 
the O 
Arabs O 
in O 
general O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
Sunnis O 
in O 
particular O 
, O 
their O 
hidden O 
hatred O 
and O 
limitless O 
detestation O 
, O 
and O 
revealed O 
their O 
dirty O 
plans O 
and O 
policy O 
. O 

Yes O 
, O 
they O 
are O 
stupid O 
otherwise O 
what O 
is O 
the O 
benefit O 
of O 
executing O 
Saddam B-PER 
Hussein I-PER 
at O 
this O 
time O 
? O 

For O 
Saddam B-PER 
Hussein I-PER 
, O 
there O 
was O 
no O 
difference O 
whether O 
he O 
was O 
executed O 
today O 
or O 
tomorrow O 
or O 
on O 
a O 
feast O 
day O 
or O 
otherwise O 
. O 

Yes O 
, O 
they O 
are O 
stupid O 
because O 
they O 
did O 
not O 
harm O 
Saddam B-PER 
but O 
themselves O 
, O 
as O 
they O 
revealed O 
their O 
wickedness O 
, O 
their O 
cunning O 
and O 
their O 
coming O 
danger O 
and O 
to O 
all O 
Moslems O 
, O 
Arabs O 
and O 
Sunnis O 
. O 

Rather O 
they O 
made O 
Saddam B-PER 
Hussein I-PER 
a O 
believing O 
martyred O 
hero O 
. O 

Many O 
Arabs O 
did O 
not O 
like O 
Saddam B-PER 
and O 
were O 
not O 
happy O 
with O 
many O 
of O 
his O 
deeds O 
, O 
but O 
after O 
his O 
execution O 
in O 
this O 
way O 
everybody O 
sympathized O 
with O 
him O 
. O 

No O 
one O 
blames O 
Saddam B-PER 
for O 
what O 
he O 
did O 
with O 
those O 
traitors O 
, O 
sons O 
of O 
temporary O 
marriages O 
, O 
Safavids O 
, O 
whose O 
noses O 
he O 
rubbed O 
in O 
the O 
ground O 
. O 

Yes O 
, O 
these O 
traitors O 
proved O 
that O 
no O 
one O 
but O 
a O 
ruler O 
like O 
Saddam B-PER 
Hussein I-PER 
can O 
make O 
them O 
act O 
straight O 
and O 
control O 
them O 
. O 

Why O 
do O 
we O 
grieve O 
for O 
a O 
man O 
whose O 
last O 
words O 
were O 
" O 
I O 
bear O 
witness O 
that O 
there O 
is O 
no O 
God O 
but O 
God O 
and O 
I O 
bear O 
witness O 
that O 
Muhammad B-PER 
is O 
the O 
prophet O 
of O 
God O 
. O 
" O 

All O 
witnessed O 
the O 
execution O 
of O 
the O 
genius O 
brave O 
leader O 
Saddam B-PER 
Hussein I-PER 
, O 
and O 
witnessed O 
his O 
bravery O 
. O 

Those O 
Safavid O 
Rafida B-PER 
crowded O 
together O 
in O 
front O 
of O 
him O 
, O 
cursing O 
and O 
mocking O 
him O 
as O 
if O 
they O 
were O 
children O 
. O 

I O 
swear O 
by O 
God O 
if O 
any O 
of O 
these O 
traitors O 
had O 
been O 
in O 
Saddam B-PER 
Hussein I-PER 
's I-PER 
place O 
you O 
would O 
have O 
seen O 
him O 
weeping O 
, O 
begging O 
or O 
at O 
least O 
fainting O 
more O 
than O 
once O 
. O 

These O 
idiots O 
did O 
not O 
know O 
that O 
they O 
had O 
made O 
a O 
martyred O 
, O 
believing O 
hero O 
out O 
of O 
Saddam B-PER 
. O 

Why O 
this O 
mockery O 
and O 
shouting O 
of O 
petty O 
slogans O 
such O 
as O 
" O 
Saddam B-PER 
go O 
to O 
hell O 
" O 
and O 
" O 
down O 
with O 
the O 
tyrant O 
" O 
and O 
others O 
? O 

Yes O 
, O 
those O 
idiots O 
proved O 
that O 
they O 
are O 
behind O 
everything O 
that O 
is O 
happening O 
to O 
the O 
Sunnis O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
and O 
all O 
this O 
is O 
no O 
one O 
's O 
setup O 
but O 
theirs O 
. O 

We O 
know O 
that O 
Saddam B-PER 
was O 
not O 
ever O 
a O 
traitor O 
or O 
lackey O 
but O 
that O 
he O 
was O 
a O 
brave O 
militant O 
leader O 
and O 
died O 
a O 
martyr O 
. O 

We O 
know O 
that O 
your O 
hatred O 
of O 
your O 
master O 
and O 
executioner O 
Saddam B-PER 
Hussein I-PER 
only O 
comes O 
from O 
the O 
fact O 
that O 
he O 
is O 
someone O 
who O 
knew O 
how O 
to O 
keep O 
you O 
in O 
check O 
and O 
trampled O 
on O 
your O 
necks O 
with O 
his O 
shoes O 
for O 
more O 
than O 
thirty O 
years O 
. O 

Only O 
an O 
ignorant O 
human O 
being O 
would O 
blame O 
Saddam B-PER 
. O 

May O 
God O 
have O 
mercy O 
on O 
you O 
Saddam B-PER 
and O 
forgive O 
you O

The B-ORG

we O 
say O 
who O 
is O

No O 
one O 
denies O 
that O 
Peres B-PER 
is O 
a O

But O 
who O 
is O 
Peres B-PER 
? O 

Peres B-PER 
received O 
the O 
Nobel O 
Peace O 
Prize O 
in O 
1994 O 
. O 

Peres B-PER 
has O 
a O 
special O 
interest O 
in O 
precision O 
electronics O 
. O 

In O 
1997 O 
, O 
he O 
established O 
the B-ORG 
" I-ORG 
Peres I-ORG 
Center I-ORG 
for I-ORG 
Peace I-ORG

" O 

Peres B-PER 
spent O

establishing O 
the B-ORG 
Peres I-ORG

while O 
Yasser B-PER

the O

nuclear O

Peres B-PER 
attained O 
this O 
as O 
a O 
result O 
of O 
.. O 
knowledge O 
and O 
proficiency O 
.. O 
in O 
his O 
personality O 
, O 
which O 
helped O 
give O 
him O 
an O 
edge O 
in O 
confronting O 
any O 
situation O 
by O 
putting O 
him O 
in O 
a O 
position O 
of O 
strength O 
, O 
and O 
not O 
weakness O 
.. O 

We O 
also O 
find O 
that O 
most O

some O

people O 
live O 
below O 
the O

Furthermore O 
, O 
most O 
of O 
the O

do O

that O

Peres B-PER 
's O 
visit O 
to O 
the O 
students O 
' O 
hall O 
so O 
they O 
could O 
talk O 
to O 
him O 
-LRB- O 
as O 
a O 
man O 
of O

and O 
not O 
as O 
a O 
Jew O

a O

that O 
is O 
something O 
normal O 
for O 
any O

Discussion O 
of O 
the O 
Arab O 
- O 
Israeli O 
situation O 
by O 
the O 
students O 
in O 
a O 
unique O 
democratic O 
oasis O 
in O 
Qatar B-LOC 
. O 

I O 
think O 
, O 
in O 
my O 
opinion O 
, O 
that O 
if O 
democracy O 
in O 
some O 
of O 
the O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
is O 
non-existent O 
in O 
the O 
simplest O 
matters O 
related O 
to O 
their O 
personal O 
rights O 
and O 
the O 
demand O 
for O 
them O 
. O 
Then O 
how O 
could O 
they O 
reach O 
to O 
the O 
level O 
of O 
Qatar B-LOC 
in O 
gathering O 
this O 
huge O 
number O 
of O 
intellectuals O 
, O 
politicians O 
, O 
and O 
heads O 
of O 
state O 
to O 
discuss O 
sensitive O 
issues O 
that O 
concern O 
the O 
Arab O 
World O 
? O 

Conversely O 
, O 
as O 
a O 
result O 
of O 
the O 
lack O 
of O 
freedom O 
among O 
the O 
Arab O 
people O 
we O 
find O 
that O 
it O 
is O 
America B-LOC 
which O 
is O 
in O 
the O 
driver O 
's O 
seat O 
and O 
steers O 
guests O 
wherever O 
it O 
wants O 
and O 
takes O 
them O 
on O 
tours O 
without O 
any O 
questioning O 
directed O 
at O 
it O 
. O 

All O 
this O 
marginalizes O 
the O 
Arab O 
individual O 
as O 
though O 
he O 
had O 
no O 
-LRB- O 
mind O 
-RRB- O 
or O 
-LRB- O 
opinion O 
-RRB- O 
, O 
and O 
you O 
find O 
that O 
the O 
areas O 
he O 
is O 
allowed O 
to O 
talk O 
about O 
are O 
women O 
driving O 
in O 
Saudi B-LOC 
Arabia I-LOC 
and O 
similar O 
useless O 
topics O 
.. O 

I O 
would O 
like O 
to O 
explain O 
something O 
to O 
the O 
brothers O 
: O 
Peres B-PER 
's O 
visit O 
is O 
an O 
internal O 
Qatari O 
affair O 
. O 

There O 
are O 
writers O 
in O 
Qatar B-LOC 
who O 
have O 
positive O 
opinions O 
as O 
well O 
as O 
negative O 
opinions O 
. O 

While O 
he O 
was O 
leaving O 
the O 
hall O 
, O 
a O 
student O 
addressed O 
Shimon B-PER 
Peres I-PER 
with O 
the O 
word O 
" O 
terrorist O 
" O 
.. O 
" O 
terrorist O 
" O 
in O 
English O 
, O 
which O 
caused O 
the O 
accompanying O 
Qatari O 
security O 
to O 
intervene O 
to O 
prevent O 
him O 
from O 
continuing O 
. O 

This O 
name O 
is O 
used O 
by O 
17 O 
people O 
from O 
three O 
Gulf B-LOC 
States O 
! O 

The B-PER 
jesting I-PER 
of I-PER 
the I-PER 
pen I-PER 

The O 
girls O 
of O 
Qatar B-LOC 
shake O 
hands O 
with O 
the O 
dirty O 
Jewish O 
men O 
? O 

The B-PER 
poor I-PER 
slave I-PER 

Brother O 
Jasim B-PER 
... O 
may O 
Allah O 
guide O 
him O 
. O 

If O 
we O 
could O 
agree O 
that O 
we O 
fall O 
behind O 
the O 
Zionists O 
and O 
Americans O 
in O 
such O 
fields O 
... O 
however O 
the O 
problem O 
lies O 
in O 
ignoring O 
all O 
this O 
clear O 
evidence O 
that O 
the O 
scientific O 
project O 
is O 
nothing O 
but O 
a O 
small O 
misleading O 
part O 
of O 
a O 
campaign O 
meant O 
to O 
change O 
the O 
Islamic O 
Gulf B-LOC 
and O 
Qatari O 
identity O 
and O 
to O 
remove O 
its O 
established O 
fixed O 
principles O 
in O 
which O 
they O 
surpass O 
everything O 
that O 
the O 
Zionists O 
and O 
the O 
Americans O 
have O 
. O 

How O 
can O 
you O 
reconcile O 
the O 
will O 
of O 
scientific O 
and O 
technological O 
progress O 
.. O 
and O 
hosting O 
the O 
Asian O 
Olympics O 
or O 
a O 
military O 
base O 
or O 
a O 
Zionist O 
politician O 
or O 
a O 
program O 
like O 
the B-ORG 
Doha I-ORG 
Debates I-ORG 
? O 

So O 
... O 
the O 
purely O 
scientific O 
and O 
technological O 
side O 
can O 
not O 
justify O 
what O 
is O 
happening O 
in O 
Qatar B-LOC 
. O 

In O 
your O 
article O 
here O 
, O 
you O 
justified O 
the O 
legitimacy O 
of O 
hosting O 
Peres B-PER 
from O 
the O 
perspective O 
of O 
exchanging O 
opinions O 
, O 
dialogue O 
, O 
and O 
using O 
intellect O 
... O 

The O 
most O 
important O 
of O 
them O 
is O 
supporting O 
the O 
truth O 
and O 
loyalty O 
to O 
Muslims O 
even O 
if O 
it O 
goes O 
against O 
narrow O 
personal O 
interests O 
... O 
and O 
the O 
relationship O 
of O 
Saudi B-LOC 
Arabia I-LOC 
with O 
the O 
Americans O 
... O 

Despite O 
my O 
being O 
convinced O 
that O 
it O 
should O 
be O 
limited O 
after O 
the O 
latter O 
's O 
aggression O 
, O 
it O 
does O 
not O 
in O 
any O 
way O 
reach O 
the O 
level O 
of O 
the O 
relationship O 
of O 
Qatar B-LOC 
with O 
the O 
Americans O 
themselves O 
. O 

-LRB- O 
The O 
tension O 
in O 
the O 
relations O 
with O 
Saudi B-LOC 
Arabia I-LOC 
recently O 
and O 
the O 
military O 
base O 
on O 
the O 
Qatari O 
territory O 
despite O 
the O 
state O 
of O 
peace O 
in O 
the O 
region O 
are O 
evidence O 
of O 
that O 
-RRB- O 
... O 

So O 
how O 
come O 
Qatar B-LOC 
is O 
now O 
adding O 
to O 
this O 
with O 
intimate O 
relations O 
with O 
those O 
whose O 
existence O 
and O 
history O 
and O 
reality O 
are O 
entirely O 
connected O 
to O 
aggression O 
against O 
Muslims O 
.. O 
namely O 
the O 
Zionists O 
!!? O 

For O 
example O 
, O 
there O 
is O 
no O 
room O 
for O 
freedom O 
in O 
talking O 
about O 
God O 
and O 
His O 
Prophet B-PER 
and O 
His O 
verses O 
since O 
it O 
comes O 
in O 
the O 
context O 
of O 
what O 
brought O 
the O 
disbelievers O 
to O 
hell O 
. O 

There O 
is O 
no O 
room O 
for O 
leaving O 
the O 
door O 
wide O 
open O 
for O 
discussing O 
or O 
teaching O 
" O 
science O 
and O 
technology O 
" O 
as O 
the O 
theory O 
of O 
development O 
.. O 
or O 
the O 
theories O 
of O 
Darwin B-PER 
.. O 
or O 
how O 
to O 
make O 
bombs O 
or O 
liquor O 
.. O 
or O 
the O 
creeds O 
of O 
polytheism O 
or O 
excessiveness O 
in O 
regarding O 
others O 
as O 
unbelievers O 
.. O 
or O 
the O 
sciences O 
of O 
judging O 
with O 
anything O 
other O 
than O 
the O 
revelations O 
of O 
God O 
-LRB- O 
except O 
by O 
the O 
way O 
of O 
warning O 
against O 
them O 
-RRB- O 
.. O 

What O 
is O 
happening O 
in O 
Qatar B-LOC 
is O 
a O 
political O 
and O 
intellectual O 
penetration O 
in O 
the O 
countries O 
of O 
the O 
region O 
in O 
every O 
meaning O 
of O 
the O 
word O

Months O

the O

that O

" O

Al B-PER

Waleed I-PER 
had O 
lost O

Thus O 
he O 
had O 
to O 
specify O

Speaking O 
of O 
the O 
timing O 
of O 
this O 
announcement O 
and O 
the O 
reasons O 
for O 
it O 
, O 
Prince O 
Al B-PER 
- I-PER 
Waleed I-PER 
said O 
that O 
the O 
undertaking O 
to O 
pump O 
10 O 
billion O 
riyals O 
into O 
the O 
Saudi O 
market O 
was O 
made O 
last O 
March O 
. O 
and O 
that O 
the O 
investment O 
he O 
had O 
undertaken O 
was O 
not O 
completed O 
till O 
two O 
weeks O 
ago O 
and O 
therefore O 
it O 
was O 
being O 
announced O 
. O 

It O 
is O 
not O 
possible O 
to O 
believe O 
that O 
Al B-PER

been O 
" O 
only O 
" O 
collecting O 
since O 
last O 
March O 
-LRB- O 
almost O 
a O 
year O 
ago O 
-RRB- O 
until O 
now O 
. O 
Because O 
, O 
if O 
that O 
had O 
happened O 
, O 
then O 
the O 
rates O 
of O 
his O 
prices O 
would O 
be O 
much O 
higher O 
than O 
the O 
current O 
prices O 
. O 

This O 
would O 
be O 
unreasonable O 
behavior O 
from O 
an O 
opportunist O 
like O 
Al B-PER 
- I-PER 
Waleed I-PER 
. O 

the O 
first O 
is O 
to O 
send O 
a O 
signal O 
to O 
the B-ORG 
Market I-ORG 
Authority I-ORG 
that O 
he O 
does O 
not O 
want O 
to O 
create O 
a O 
very O 
strong O 
imaginary O 
surge O 

and O 
this O 
might O 
mean O 
that O 
the B-ORG 
Market I-ORG 
Authority I-ORG 
is O 
being O 
informed O 
that O 
he O 
will O 
be O 
satisfied O 
with O 
less O 
profit O 
than O 
his O 
-LRB- O 
counterpart O 
-RRB- O 
and O 
then O 
get O 
out O 
. O 

" O 
the B-ORG

investing O

Here O 
Al B-PER

Waleed I-PER 
confirms O 
sowing O 
of O 
trust O 
in O 
the O 
hearts O 
of O 
speculators O 
but O 
only O 
if O 
they O 
enter O

give O 
a O 
boost O 
to O 
his O

It O 
is O 
the O

the O

Al B-PER

Waleed I-PER

get O

is O 
the O 
weapon O 
that O 
covers O 
the O

especially O 
as O 
Al B-PER

have O 
heard O

used O 
to O 
defend O 
Iran B-LOC

the O 
Arab O 
street O

and O 
they O 
have O 
totally O 
turned O

started O 
to O 
call O 
it O 
" O 
dirty O

a O 
lot O 
of O 
loathing O

hatred O

Hezbollah B-ORG

his O 
insistence O

the O

lost O

As O 
we O

, O 
most O 
of O 
the O

by O 
the B-ORG

in O

the O 
most O

its O

was O 
on O 
other O

Nevertheless O 
, O 
the O 
benefits O 
would O 
have O 
encompassed O 
all O

it O

It O 
is O

us O 
to O 
seek O

the O

that O 
we O 
have O 
local O

in O 
Mesopotamia B-LOC

The O 
idea O 
is O 
drawn O 
from O 
the O 
experience O 
of O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
State O 
of O 
Alaska B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
it O 
means O 
moving O 
away O 
from O 
public O

even O 
in O 
the O 
vital O 
sectors O 
, O 
as O 
it O 
is O 
an O 
alternative O

Also O 
, O 
the O 
main O 
economic O 
problems O 
in O

currently O 
do O 
not O 
lie O 
in O

in O

The O 
root O

that O

It O

a O 
fact O

such O

the O

it O

it O 
only O 
after O

what O

in O

before O 
you O 
fight O

win O

by O

otherwise O 
, O 
you O 
have O 
to O 
realize O 
that O 
you O 
are O 
in O 
a O 
war O

and O 
this O 
may O 
take O 
Europe B-LOC 
a O 
few O 
more O

. O 

I O 
do O 
not O 
want O 
to O 
comment O 
here O 
on O 
whether O 
the O 
American O 
- O 
led O 
attack O 
on O 
Iraq B-LOC 
was O 
justified O 
from O 
the O 
point O 
of O 
view O 
of O 
weapons O 
of O 
mass O 
destruction O 
or O 
any O 
other O 
pre-war O 
argument O 
, O 
but O 
I O 
can O 
look O 
at O 
the O 
post-war O 
map O 
of O 
Western B-LOC 
Asia I-LOC 
. O 

Now O 
that O 
Afghanistan B-LOC 
, O 
Iraq B-LOC 
and O 
Libya B-LOC 
are O 
out O 
, O 
two O 
and O 
a O 
half O 
terrorist O 
states O 
remain O 
: O 
Iran B-LOC 
, O 
Syria B-LOC 
and O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
, O 
the O 
latter O 
being O 
a O 
Syrian O 
colony O 
. O 

Perhaps O 
Sudan B-LOC 
should O 
be O 
added O 
to O 
the O 
list O 
. O 

As O 
a O 
result O 
of O 
the O 
conquest O 
of O 
Afghanistan B-LOC 
and O 
Iraq B-LOC 
, O 
both O 
Iran B-LOC 
and O 
Syria B-LOC 
are O 
now O 
totally O 
surrounded O 
by O 
territories O 
unfriendly O 
to O 
them O 
. O 

Iran B-LOC 
is O 
encircled O 
by O 
Afghanistan B-LOC 
, O 
by O 
the B-LOC 
Gulf I-LOC 
States I-LOC 
, O 
Iraq B-LOC

the O 
Moslem O

the O 
former O

Syria B-LOC 
is O 
surrounded O 
by O 
Turkey B-LOC 
, O 
Iraq B-LOC 
, O 
Jordan B-LOC 
and O 
Israel B-LOC 
. O 

It O 
is O 
not O 
surprising O 
that O 
Iran B-LOC 
is O 
so O 
active O 
in O 
trying O 
to O 
incite O 
a O 
Shiite O 
uprising O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
. O 

I O 
do O 
not O 
know O 
if O 
the O 
American O 
plan O 
was O 
actually O 
to O 
encircle O 
both O 
Iran B-LOC 
and O 
Syria B-LOC 
, O 
but O 
that O 
is O 
the O 
resulting O 
situation O 
. O 

In O 
my O 
humble O 
opinion O 
, O 
the O 
number O 
one O 
danger O 
to O 
the O 
world O 
today O 
is O 
Iran B-LOC 
and O 
its O 
regime O 
. O 

Iran B-LOC 
sponsors O 
Syrian O 
terrorism O 
, O 

it O 
is O 
certainly O 
behind O 
much O 
of O 
the O 
action O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
, O 

it O 
is O 
fully O 
funding O 
the O 
Hezbollah B-ORG 
and O 
, O 
through O 
it O 
, O 
the O 
Palestinian O 
Hamas B-ORG 
and O 
Islamic B-ORG 
Jihad I-ORG 
; O 

it O 
performed O 
acts O 
of O 
terror O 
at O 
least O 
in O 
Europe B-LOC 
and O 
in O 
South B-LOC 
America I-LOC 
and O 
probably O 
also O 
in O 
Uzbekistan B-LOC 
and O 
Saudi B-LOC 
Arabia I-LOC 

and O 
it O 
truly O 
leads O 
a O 
multi-national O 
terror O 
consortium O 
, O 
which O 
includes O 
, O 
as O 
minor O 
players O 
, O 
Syria B-LOC 
, O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
and O 
certain O 
Shiite O 
elements O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
. O 

Nevertheless O 
, O 
most O 
European O 
countries O 
still O 
trade O 
with O 
Iran B-LOC 
, O 
try O 
to O 
appease O 
it O 
and O 
refuse O 
to O 
read O 
the O 
clear O 
signals O 
. O 

It O 
is O 
pointless O 
to O 
try O 
to O 
understand O 
the O 
subtle O 
differences O 
between O 
the O 
Sunni O 
terror O 
of O 
Al B-ORG 
Qaeda I-ORG 
and O 
Hamas B-ORG 
and O 
the O 
Shiite O 
terror O 
of O 
Hezbollah B-ORG 
, O 
Sadr B-ORG 
and O 
other O 
Iranian O 
- O 
inspired O 
enterprises O 
. O 

No O 
one O 
will O 
ever O 
know O 
whether O 
the O 
recent O 
elections O 
in O 
Spain B-LOC 
would O 
have O 
yielded O 
a O 
different O 
result O 
, O 
if O 
not O 
for O 
the O 
train O 
bombings O 
a O 
few O 
days O 
earlier O 
. O 

What O 
matters O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
terrorists O 
believe O 
that O 
they O 
caused O 
the O 
result O 
and O 
that O 
they O 
won O 
by O 
driving O 
Spain B-LOC 
out O 
of O 
Iraq B-LOC 
. O 

The O 
Spanish O 
story O 
will O 
surely O 
end O 
up O 
being O 
extremely O 
costly O 
to O 
other O 
European O 
countries O 
, O 
including O 
France B-LOC 
, O 
who O 
is O 
now O 
expelling O 
inciting O

and O 
forbidding O 
veils O 
and O 
including O 
others O 
who O 
sent O 
troops O 
to O 
Iraq B-LOC 
. O 

In O 
the O 
long O 
run O 
, O 
Spain B-LOC 
itself O 
will O 
pay O 
even O 
more O 
. O 

We O 
have O 
seen O 
it O 
already O 
in O 
Algeria B-LOC 
and O 
, O 
to O 
a O 
certain O 
extent O 
, O 
in O 
Turkey B-LOC 
. O 

On O 
the O 
other O 
hand O 
, O 
a O 
certain O 
transition O 
democracy O 
, O 
as O 
in O 
Jordan B-LOC 
, O 
may O 
be O 
a O 
better O 
temporary O 
solution O 
, O 
paving O 
the O 
way O 
for O 
the O 
real O 
thing O 
, O 
perhaps O 
in O 
the O 
same O 
way O 
that O 
an O 
immediate O 
sudden O

did O 
not O 
work O 
in O

and O 
would O 
not O

But O 
tell O 
me O 
, O 
Captain O

if O 
you O 
know O

a O 
decent O 
place O

rapidly O

His O 
story O 
was O 
unsubstantiated O 
and O 
exteme O 
, O 
yet O 
plausible O 
because O 
it O

But O

it O 
now O

is O 
the O

it O

both O

if O 
you O

see O

you O 
have O 
to O 
cross O

Originally O 
, O 
North B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
had O 
not O

It O

the O 
number O

So O 
people O

not O

, O 
after O 
all O 
, O 
China B-LOC

North B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
are O 
not O 
enemies O 
and O 
it O 
is O 
still O 
possible O 
to O 
cross O

you O 
talk O

the O 
North B-LOC

Our O

When O 
the O

we O

real O 
Jackson B-PER 
story O 
ran O 
in O 
the B-ORG 
New I-ORG 
York I-ORG 
Daily I-ORG 
News I-ORG 
, O 
under O 
the O 
snappy O 
banner O 
`` O 
Creepy O 
dad O 
was O 
root O 
of O 
all O 
clan O 
's O 
woe O 
, O 
singer O 
sez O 
. O 
'' O 

The O 
singer O 
was O 
brother O 
Jermaine B-PER 
, O 
and O 
the O 
claims O 
based O 
on O 
the O 
projected O 
outline O 
for O 
his O 
abandoned O 
`` O 
tell O 
- O 
all O 
'' O 
family O 
story O 
. O 

Reading O 
that O 
Joseph B-PER 
was O 
a O 
nightmare O 
of O 
a O 
father O 
and O 
sexually O 
abusive O 
towards O 
his O 
daughters O 
is O 
not O 
exactly O 
a O 
`` O 
stop O 
the O 
presses O 
'' O 
moment O 
. O 

He O 
said O 
he O 
sensed O 
something O 
was O 
wrong O 
because O 
Michael B-PER 
would O 
be O 
sick O 
for O 
days O 
after O 
. O 

This O 
lifts O 
the O 
Jackson B-PER 
family O 
horror O 
show O 
to O 
a O 
whole O 
new O 
order O 
of O 
dysfunction O 
, O 
one O 
that O 
sees O 
parents O 
network O 
with O 
power O 
and O 
trade O 
their O 
children O 
for O 
privilege O 
. O 

Perhaps O 
we O 
can O 
take O 
more O 
from O 
this O 
than O 
the O 
suspicion O 
that O 
the O 
Jackson B-PER 
clan O 
had O 
gotten O 
with O 
the O 
program O 
. O 

-LRB- O 
This O 
is O 
how O 
I O 
tend O 
to O 
think O 
of O 
Ponchatoula B-LOC 
's O 
Hosanna B-ORG 
Church I-ORG 
. O 
-RRB- O 

Yet O 
we O 
should O 
n't O 
discount O 
the O 
suspicion O 
, O 
either O 
, O 
particularly O 
given O 
some O 
of O 
Michael B-PER 
's O 
paranormal O 
interests O 
and O 
peculiar O 
associations O 
. O 

His O 
close O 
friendship O 
with O 
SPECTRA B-ORG 
contactee O 
and O 
channeller O 
of O 
the O 
Nine O 
, O 
Uri B-PER 
Geller I-PER 
, O 
for O 
one O 
instance O 
. O 

Even O 
if O 
you O 
wanted O 
to O 
, O 
you O 
wo O 
n't O 
be O 
reading O 
Jermaine B-PER 
's O 
account O 
now O 
. O 

Like O 
every O 
Jackson B-ORG 
sibling O 
who O 
's O 
tried O 
to O 
break O 
from O 
Joe B-PER 
, O 
he O 
's O 
climbed O 
down O 
, O 
returned O 
to O 
the O 
fold O 
and O 
scrapped O 
the O 
book O 
, O 
apparently O 
on O 
the O 
strength O 
of O 
Michael B-PER 
's O 
threats O 
to O 
sue O 
. O 

Previously O 
, O 
Michael B-PER 
's O 
given O 
cause O 
for O 
family O 
observers O 
to O 
attribute O 
his O 
grotesque O 
body O 
dysmorphia O 
to O 
a O 
dread O 
of O 
resembling O 
his O 
father O 
. O 

Yet O 
there O 
they O 
were O 
at O 
Jackson B-PER 
's O 
trial O 
last O 
year O 
, O 
hand O 
in O 
hand O 
. O 

In O 
the O 
big O 
picture O 
Michael B-PER 
Jackson I-PER 
means O 
not O 
very O 
much O 
. O 

having O 
departed O
