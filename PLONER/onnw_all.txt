He O 
confirmed O 
that O 
the O

movement O

continue O 
on O 
the O 
road O 
of O 
resistance O 
until O 
the O 
occupied O

He O 
added O 
that O

The O 
British O 
Prime O

called O 
on O 
the O 
moderate O 
leaders O 
in O 
the B-LOC 
Middle I-LOC 
East I-LOC

join O 
what O 
he O 
called O 
a O 
horrific O 
struggle O 
between O 
democracy O 
and O 
extremism O 
. O 

And O 
is O 
it O 
reasonable O 
that O 
these O 
crimes O 
occur O 
and O 
that O 
the O 
noble O 
sons O 
of O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
who O 
fight O 
for O 
freedom O 
and O 
sovereignty O 
continue O 
to O 
be O 
eliminated O 
one O 
after O 
the O 
other O 
, O 
and O 
that O 
certain O 
Arab O 
countries O 
still O 
have O 
reservations O 
about O 
the O 
international O 
court O 
? O 

Does O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
not O 
have O 
the O 
right O 
to O 
set O 
an O 
example O 
by O 
punishing O 
the O 
murderers O 
of O 
its O 
officials O 
and O 
its O 
youth O 
? O 

And O 
preventing O 
the O 
adoption O 
of O 
the O 
international O 
court O 
is O 
a O 
response O 
to O 
the O 
will O 
of O 
those O 
murderers O 
who O 
want O 
to O 
eliminate O 
Lebanon B-LOC

youth O

to O 
all O

a O 
promising O 
future O 
in O

sovereign O

independent O 
country O

What O 
is O 
noticeable O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
murderers O 
target O 
the O 
youth O 
who O 
have O 
a O 
role O 
to O 
play O 
in O 
the O 
country O

who O 
follow O 
the O 
principles O 
that O 
Pierre B-PER 
Gemayel I-PER 
followed O 
which O 
are O 
independence O 
, O 
boldness O

courage O 
. O 

Lebanon B-LOC

being O 
subjected O 
to O 
destabilization O

no O 
state O

foreign O 
or O 
Arab O

has O 
the O 
right O

a O 
glimmer O

There O 
is O 
no O

that O

all O

The B-ORG

in O

The B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Statistical I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
forecasts O 
that O 
the O 
global O 
economy O 
will O 
continue O 
growing O 
in O 
1996 O 
and O 
that O 
this O 
favorable O 
situation O 
is O 
extremely O 
beneficial O 
for O 
China B-LOC 
's O 
development O 
and O 
will O 
provide O 
many O 
development O 
opportunities O 
. O 

The O 
whole O 
region O 
's O 
economic O 
growth O 
rate O 
will O 
reach O 
7.9 O 
percent O 
, O 
with O 
China B-LOC 
's O 
growth O 
rate O 
possibly O 
being O 
as O 
high O 
as O 
9.7 O 
percent O 
. O 

According O 
to O 
the O 
analysis O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Statistical I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
, O 
the O 
extremely O 
favorable O 
conditions O 
for O 
China B-LOC 
's O 
economic O 
development O 
mainly O 
comprise O 
of O 
two O 
aspects O 
: O 
the O 
first O 
being O 
the O 
sustained O 
growth O 
of O 
the O 
world O 
economy O 
and O 
international O 
trade O 
, O 
which O 
indicates O 
the O

, O 
provides O 
a O 
comparatively O 
favorable O 
international O 
environment O 
for O 
China B-LOC 
's O 
export O 
trade O 
development O 
. O 

The O 
second O 
is O 
China B-LOC 
's O 
large O 
margin O 
reduction O 
of O 
tariffs O 
in O 
1996 O 
which O 
will O

environment O 
and O 
attract O 
more O 
foreign O 
businessmen O 
to O 
come O 
to O 
invest O 
. O 

The O 
analysis O 
shows O 
that O 
, O 
with O 
the O 
situation O 
of O 
greater O 
opportunity O 
and O 
extremely O 
favorable O 
international O 
situations O 
, O 
China B-LOC

so O 
as O 
to O 
improve O 
its O

. O 

According O 
to O

, O 
at O

, O 
the O 
rising O 
speed O 
of O

also O

Mr. O 
Stoll B-PER 
draws O 
his O 
title O 
from O 
the O 
cuckoo O 
's O 
habit O 
of O 
laying O 
eggs O 
in O 
the O 
nests O 
of O 
other O 
birds O 
, O 
making O 
them O 
surrogate O 
parents O 
. O 

He O 
discovered O 
a O 
75 O

discrepancy O 
in O 
the O 
charges O 
made O 
to O 
various O 
departments O 
for O 
computer O 
time O 
and O 
traced O 
it O 
to O 
a O 
user O 
named O 
`` O 
Hunter B-PER 
, O 
'' O 
who O 
had O 
no O 
valid O 
billing O

. O 

Mr. O 
Stoll B-PER 
suspected O 
the O 
intruder O 
was O 
one O 
of O 
those O 
precocious O 
students O 
who O 
has O 
fun O 
breaking O 
into O 
computers O 
. O 

Finding O 
him O 
became O 
an O 
obsession O 
for O 
Mr. O 
Stoll B-PER 
. O 

When O 
the O 
hacker O 
moved O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Stoll B-PER 
moved O 
too O 
, O 
calling O 
up O 
other O 
systems O 
managers O 
to O 
alert O 
them O 
but O 
keeping O 
his O 
own O 
system O 
open O 
to O 
avoid O 
arousing O 
suspicion O

Instead O 
, O 
they O 
figure O 
the O

probably O 
took O

A O

know O 
Mr. O 
Wakeman B-PER

age O

But O 
then O 
Judge O 
O'Kicki B-PER 
often O 
behaved O 
like O 
a O 
man O 
who O 
would O 
be O 
king O

and O 
, O 
some O

, O 
an O

According O

more O

As O 
a O 
result O 
, O 
says O 
Mr. O 
Geiger B-PER 
, O 
lawyers O 
think O 
twice O 
before O 
appealing O 
a O 
judge O

ruling O 
, O 
are O 
reluctant O 
to O 
mount O 
, O 
or O 
even O 
support O 
, O 
challenges O 
against O 
him O 
for O 
re-election O 
and O 
are O 
usually O 
loath O 
to O 
file O 
complaints O 
that O 
might O 
impugn O 
a O

integrity O

Judge O 
O'Kicki B-PER 
, O 
a O 
stern O 
and O 
forbidding O 
- O 
looking O 
man O 
, O 
has O 
been O 
a O 
fixture O 
in O 
the O 
local O 
legal O 
community O 
for O 
more O

two O

For O 
more O 
than O 
a O

, O 
virtually O 
no O 
one O 
complained O 
about O 
Judge O 
O'Kicki B-PER 
. O 

`` O 
The O

never O 
made O 
a O 
pretense O 
of O 
repaying O 
the O 
money O 
, O 
'' O 
said O 
Mr. O 
Green B-PER 
. O 

Eventually O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Green B-PER 
testified O 
, O 
he O 
began O 
ducking O 
out O 
of O 
his O 
office O 
rather O 
than O 
face O 
the O 
judge O 
when O 
he O 
visited O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Green B-PER 
thought O 
little O 
of O 
it O 
, O 
he O 
told O 
the O 
grand O 
jury O 
, O 
until O 
the O 
judge O 
walked O 
up O 
to O 
him O 
after O 
the O 
courtroom O 
had O 
cleared O 
and O 
suggested O 
a O 
kickback O 
. O 

`` O

Mr. O

said O 
the O 
judge O 
asked O 
him O 
. O 

Appalled O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Green B-PER 
never O 
paid O 
the O 
money O 
, O 
he O 
testified O 
. O 

`` O 
I O 
do O 
n't O 
have O

the O 
years O

that O 
the O

at O

one O

The O 
ever O

optimistic O 
Mr. O

has O 
learned O 
that O 
while O 
acquiring O 
a O

can O 
be O 
a O 
shortcut O

can O 
also O 
bring O 
a O

there O 
were O 
hitches O

the O

of O 
which O 
was O 
that O 
, O 
Mr. O

, O 
he O 
proceeded O 
almost O 
blindly O 
in O 
doing O 
the O

, O 
which O 
was O 
completed O 
in O 
January O 
1988 O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Wathen B-PER 
says O 
his O 
turnaround O 
strategy O 
has O 
been O 
simple O 
: O 
just O 
hack O 
away O 
at O 
the O 
fat O

But O 
Mr. O 
Wathen B-PER

still O 
must O 
pay O 
down O 
about O

the O

Mr. O

also O 
was O 
eager O

, O 
he O 
did O 
; O 
the O 
quotes O 
above O 
are O 
from O 
Mr. O 
Baker B-PER 
's O 
speech O 
of O 
two O 
weeks O 
ago O 
. O 

But O 
everyone O 
agrees O 
that O 
Mr. O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
's O 
problems O 
result O 
from O 
the O 
failure O 
of O 
his O 
own O 
system O 
. O 

In O 
short O 
, O 
the O 
problem O 
is O 
not O 
intra-administration O 
disagreement O 
, O 
but O 
preoccupation O 
with O 
the O 
prospect O 
that O 
perestrokia O 
might O 
fail O 
, O 
and O 
its O 
political O 
opponents O 
will O 
ask O 
`` O 
Who O 
lost O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
? O 
'' O 

It O 
is O 
in O 
the O 
Western O 
interest O 
to O 
see O 
Mr. O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
succeed O 
. O 

Surely O 
there O 
is O 
someone O 
in O 
the O 
administration O 
, O 
maybe O 
Bob B-PER 
Gates I-PER 
, O 
who O 
could O 
explain O 
them O 
to O 
college O 
students O 
, O 
or O 
even O 
schoolchildren O 
. O 

Vernon B-PER 
E. I-PER 
Jordan I-PER 
was O 
elected O 
to O 
the O 
board O 
of O 
this O 
transportation O 
services O 
concern O 
. O 

The O 
Thurmond B-PER 
bill O 
would O 
also O 
add O 
five O 
new O 
crimes O 
punishable O 
by O 
death O 
, O 
including O 
murder O 
for O 
hire O 
. O 

Executions O 
, O 
regardless O 
of O 
how O 
frequently O 
they O 
occur O 
, O 
are O 
also O 
`` O 
proper O 
retribution O 
'' O 
for O 
heinous O 
crimes O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Hatch B-PER 
argues O 
. O 

The O 
amendment O 
prompted O 
an O 
ironic O 
protest O 
from O 
Mr. O 
Thurmond B-PER 
, O 
who O 
complained O 
that O 
it O 
would O 
`` O 
kill O 
'' O 
capital O 
punishment O 
. O 

And O 
the O 
Kennedy B-PER 
amendment O 
would O 
invade O 
not O 
only O 
federal O 
but O 
state O 
sentencings O 
, O 
in O 
two O 
important O 
ways O 
. O 

`` O 
That O 
burden O 
is O 
very O 
difficult O 
, O 
if O 
not O 
impossible O 
, O 
to O 
meet O 
, O 
'' O 
says O 
Mr. O 
Boyd B-PER 
. O 

Since O 
most O 
prosecutors O 
would O 
n't O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
demonstrate O 
conclusively O 
that O 
racial O 
considerations O 
did O 
n't O 
affect O 
sentencing O 
, O 
executions O 
everywhere O 
might O 
come O 
to O 
a O 
halt O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Boyd B-PER 
explains O 
. O 

But O 
if O 
it O 
survives O 
, O 
it O 
could O 
prompt O 
other O 
statutory O 
changes O 
, O 
according O 
to O 
the O 
Mr. O 
Burr B-PER 
. O 

Judith B-PER 
Elkin I-PER 
, O 
lawyer O 
for O 
the O 
creditors O 
, O 
said O 
the O 
creditors O 
group O 
is O 
challenging O 
certain O 
accounting O 
entries O 
on O 
the O 
parent O 
company O 
's O 
books O 
and O 
estimates O 
that O 
the O

owed O

be O 
as O 
much O 
as O

40 O

But O 
Mr. O 
Iacocca B-PER 
's O 
remarks O 
are O 
the O 
most O 
specific O 
indication O 
to O 
date O 
of O 
how O 
many O 
plants O 
could O 
be O 
in O 
jeopardy O 
. O 

`` O 
Unless O 
the O 
market O 
goes O 
to O 
19 O

-- O 
which O 
we O 
all O 
know O 
it O 
's O 
not O 
going O

we O 
have O 
the O 
inescapable O 
fact O 
that O 
the O 
transplants O 
are O 
adding O 
capacity O 
, O 
'' O 
Mr. O 
Lutz B-PER 
said O 
last O 
month O 
. O 

Any O 
reorganization O 
proposal O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Sells B-PER 
said O 
, O 
is O 
difficult O 
to O 
assess O 
because O 
it O 
must O 
be O 
agreed O 
upon O 
by O 
the O 
company O 
, O 
bondholders O 
, O 
banks O 
and O 
other O 
creditors O 
. O 

The O 
high O 
point O 
of O 
foreigners O 
' O 
copper O 
stocks O 
this O 
year O 
was O 
136,000 O 
tons O 
at O 
the O 
end O 
of O 
April O 
, O 
according O 
to O 
Mr. O 
Demler B-PER 
. O 

Their O 
only O 
doubt O 
concerned O 
the O 
possibility O 
that O 
Mr. O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
might O 
not O 
survive O 
the O 
opposition O 
that O 
his O 
reforms O 
would O 
arouse O 
and O 
that O 
the O 
whole O 
process O 
might O 
be O 
reversed O 
. O 

If O 
Mr. O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
's O 
goal O 
is O 
the O 
creation O 
of O 
a O 
free O 
market O 
, O 
he O 
and O 
these O 
Western O 
observers O 
have O 
good O 
reason O 
to O 
fear O 
for O 
his O 
future O 
, O 
as O 
economic O 
liberalization O 
within O 
communist O 
societies O 
leads O 
inexorably O 
to O 
demands O 
for O 
fundamental O 
political O 
reform O 
accompanied O 
by O 
civil O 
unrest O 
. O 

Indeed O 
, O 
the O 
Soviet O 
miners O 
strike O 
this O 
summer O 
clearly O 
demonstrated O 
that O 
Mr. O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
must O 
proceed O 
with O 
economic O 
reform O 
. O 

An O 
alternative O 
and O 
more O 
convincing O 
explanation O 
, O 
confirmed O 
by O 
recent O 
events O 
and O 
a O 
close O 
inspection O 
of O 
the O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
program O 
, O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
new O 
Soviet O 
economic O 
and O 
social O 
structures O 
are O 
intended O 
to O 
conform O 
to O 
a O 
model O 
other O 
than O 
that O 
of O 
the O 
market O 
. O 

If O 
Mr. O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
is O 
looking O 
toward O 
unleashing O 
the O 
productive O 
forces O 
of O 
the O 
market O 
, O 
these O 
latest O 
resolutions O 
are O 
nothing O 
short O 
of O 
reckless O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
has O 
ruled O 
out O 
the O 
use O 
of O 
the O 
market O 
to O 
solve O 
the O 
problem O 
of O 
insufficient O 
consumer O 
goods O 
. O 

Having O 
rejected O 
central O 
economic O 
planning O 
for O 
economic O 
reasons O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
market O 
for O 
fear O 
of O 
the O 
social O 
-LRB- O 
political O 
-RRB- O 
consequences O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
seeks O 
a O 
`` O 
third O 
way O 
'' O 
that O 
would O 
combine O 
the O 
discipline O 
and O 
controls O 
of O 
the O 
former O 
with O 
the O 
economic O 
benefits O 
of O 
the O 
latter O 
. O 

Indeed O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
's O 
proposals O 
display O 
a O 
close O 
conceptual O 
resemblance O 
to O 
the O 
tenets O 
of O 
Italian O 
fascism O 
, O 
whose O 
architects O 
spoke O 
specifically O 
of O 
a O 
`` O 
third O 
way O 
'' O 
: O 
of O 
having O 
produced O 
a O 
historic O 
synthesis O 
of O 
socialism O 
and O 
capitalism O 
. O 

The O 
emergence O 
of O 
Russian O 
corporatism O 
had O 
been O 
anticipated O 
in O 
journalist O 
George B-PER 
Urban I-PER 
's O 
introduction O 
to O 
a O 
series O 
of O 
colloquies O 
-- O 
`` O 
Can O 
the O 
Soviet O 
System O 
Survive O 
Reform O 
? O 
'' O 
-- O 
published O 
this O 
spring O 
. O 

To O 
ensure O 
the O 
loyalty O 
of O 
the O 
business O 
sector O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
may O 
offer O 
concessions O 
and O 
powers O 
that O 
will O 
allow O 
the O 
business O 
community O 
to O 
preserve O 
its O 
own O 
interests O 
, O 
probably O 
by O 
restricting O 
competition O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
must O 
ensure O 
that O 
within O 
this O 
`` O 
alliance O 
'' O 
the O 
business O 
sector O 
remains O 
subordinate O 
to O 
the O 
party O 
. O 

By O 
providing O 
workers O 
with O 
the O 
opportunity O 
to O 
move O 
into O 
the O 
private O 
sector O 
where O 
wages O 
tend O 
to O 
be O 
higher O 
, O 
and O 
by O 
holding O 
out O 
the O 
promise O 
of O 
more O 
consumer O 
goods O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
hopes O 
to O 
revive O 
the O 
popularity O 
of O 
the O 
party O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
would O 
appear O 
to O 
see O 
his O 
central O 
task O 
, O 
however O 
, O 
as O 
that O 
of O 
ensuring O 
that O 
foundations O 
of O 
an O 
alliance O 
among O 
labor O 
, O 
capital O 
and O 
the O 
state O 
are O 
properly O 
laid O 
before O 
the O 
demands O 
for O 
a O 
multiparty O 
system O 
reach O 
a O 
crescendo O 
. O 

The O 
weaknesses O 
in O 
his O 
plan O 
do O 
not O 
lie O 
in O 
the O 
political O 
calculations O 
-- O 
Mr. O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
is O 
a O 
consummate O 
political O 
leader O 
, O 
perhaps O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
greatest O 
-- O 
but O 
in O 
its O 
economic O 
prescription O 
. O 

Contrary O 
to O 
widespread O 
belief O 
, O 
Mussolini B-PER 
failed O 
to O 
live O 
up O 
to O 
his O 
promise O 
to O 
make O 
the O 
trains O 
run O 
on O 
time O 
; O 
it O 
is O 
doubtful O 
whether O 
Soviet O 
- O 
style O 
corporatism O 
will O 
make O 
Soviet O 
trains O 
run O 
on O 
time O 
, O 
or O 
fill O 
the O

with O

desperately O 
crave O

baby O 
. O 

Because O 
of O 
the O 
isolation O 
of O 
the O 
retinoblastoma O 
tumor O 
- O 
suppressor O 
gene O 
, O 
it O 
became O 
possible O 
last O 
January O 
to O 
find O 
out O 
what O 
threat O 
the O 
Quinlan B-PER 
baby O 
faced O 
. O 

A O 
test O 
using O 
new O 
`` O 
genetic O 
probes O 
'' O 
showed O 
that O 
little O 
Will B-PER 
Quinlan I-PER 
had O 
not O 
inherited O 
a O 
damaged O 
retinoblastoma O 
supressor O 
gene O 
and O 
, O 
therefore O 
, O 
faced O 
no O 
more O 
risk O 
than O 
other O 
children O 
of O 
developing O 
the O 
rare O 
cancer O 
. O 

`` O 
It O 
made O 
our O 
New O 
Year O 
, O 
'' O 
says O 
Mr. O 
Quinlan B-PER 
. O 

Dr. O 
Dryja B-PER 
made O 
his O 
retinoblastoma O 
discovery O 
in O 
1986 O 
. O 

The O 
story O 
of O 
tumor O 
- O 
suppressor O 
genes O 
goes O 
back O 
to O 
the O 
1970s O 
, O 
when O 
a O 
pediatrician O 
named O 
Alfred B-PER 
G. I-PER 
Knudson I-PER 
Jr. I-PER 
proposed O 
that O 
retinoblastoma O 
stemmed O 
from O 
two O 
separate O 
genetic O 
defects O 
. O 

But O 
there O 
was O 
no O 
way O 
to O 
prove O 
Dr. O 
Knudson B-PER 
's O 
`` O 
two O 
- O 
hit O 
'' O 
theory O 
. O 

Dr. O 
Knudson B-PER 
found O 
that O 
some O 
children O 
with O 
the O 
eye O 
cancer O 
had O 
inherited O 
a O 
damaged O 
copy O 
of O 
chromosome O 
No. O 
13 O 
from O 
a O 
parent O 
who O 
had O 
had O 
the O 
disease O 
. O 

But O 
Dr. O 
Vogelstein B-PER 
had O 
yet O 
to O 
nail O 
the O 
identity O 
of O 
the O 
gene O 
that O 
, O 
if O 
damaged O 
, O 
flipped O 
a O 
colon O 
cell O 
into O 
full O 
- O 
blown O 
malignancy O 
. O 

When O 
they O 
found O 
it O 
last O 
winter O 
, O 
Dr. O 
Vogelstein B-PER 
was O 
dubious O 
that O 
the O 
search O 
was O 
over O 
. O 

The O 
deletion O 
Dr. O 
Vogelstein B-PER 
found O 
was O 
in O 
exactly O 
the O 
same O 
spot O 
as O 
p53 O 
. O 

Dr. O 
Vogelstein B-PER 
hopes O 
soon O 
to O 
isolate O 
one O 
on O 
chromosome O 
18 O 
, O 
also O 
involved O 
in O 
colon O 
cancer O 
. O 

Dr. O 
Minna B-PER 
believes O 
people O 
who O 
inherit O 
a O 
defective O 
gene O 
somewhere O 
on O 
one O 
of O 
their O 
two O 
copies O 
of O 
chromosome O 
3 O 
are O 
especially O 
prone O 
to O 
lung O 
cancer O 
. O 

Justice O 
Rubin B-PER 
, O 
a O 
state O 
judge O 
since O 
1969 O 
, O 
said O 
the O 
mandatory O 
- O 
retirement O 
age O 
hurts O 
the O 
court O 
system O 
because O 
it O 
deprives O 
the O 
state O 
of O 
experienced O 
judges O 
still O 
capable O 
of O 
serving O 
on O 
the O 
bench O 
. O 

The O 
issue O 
is O 
one O 
of O 
a O 
judge O 
's O 
experience O 
, O 
his O 
competence O 
and O 
his O 
physical O 
ability O 
to O 
serve O 
on O 
the O 
bench O 
, O 
'' O 
Justice O 
Rubin B-PER 
said O 
. O 

Because O 
Justice O 
Rubin B-PER 
turned O 
76 O 
on O 
May O 
9 O 
, O 
he O 
is O 
n't O 
eligible O 
to O 
be O 
reappointed O 
to O 
the O 
bench O 
at O 
the O 
end O 
of O 
the O 
year O 
. O 

In O 
February O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Thornburgh B-PER 
announced O 
his O 
plan O 
to O 
abolish O 
the O 
units O 
. O 

Opponents O 
say O 
Mr. O 
Thornburgh B-PER 
's O 
plan O 
will O 
needlessly O 
break O 
up O

, O 
tightly O 
knit O

that O 
have O 
successfully O 
prosecuted O

`` O 
Those O

continue O 
, O 
'' O 
Ms. O 
Brevetti B-PER 
says O 
. O 

But O 
Mr. O 
Runkel B-PER 
contends O 
there O 
has O 
been O 
no O 
exodus O 
of O

. O 

He O 
says O 
27 O

have O 
left O 
and O 
21 O 
have O 
been O 
hired O 
since O 
Mr. O 
Thornburgh B-PER

his O

The O 
woman O 
appeared O 
in O 
court O 
Thursday O 
to O 
enter O 
her O 
plea O 
, O 
but O 
when O 
she O 
started O 
to O 
approach O 
the O 
bench O 
, O 
she O 
was O 
stopped O 
by O 
Judge O 
Hancock B-PER 
. O 

He O 
told O 
the O 
woman O 
's O 
lawyer O 
, O 
Victor B-PER 
Blaine I-PER 
, O 
that O 
the O 
short O 
skirt O 
was O 
inappropriate O 
for O 
a O 
court O 
appearance O 
. O 

Despite O 
Mr. O 
Blaine B-PER 
's O 
protests O 
, O 
the O 
judge O 
rescheduled O 
her O 
case O 
for O 
Nov. O 
27 O 
. O 

Judge O 
Hancock B-PER 
did O 
n't O 
return O 
phone O 
calls O 
. O 

The O 
ad O 
agency O 
had O 
approached O 
Ms. O 
Midler B-PER 
about O 
appearing O 
, O 
but O 
she O 
declined O 
, O 
citing O 
a O 
longstanding O 
policy O 
of O 
refusing O 
advertising O 
work O 
. O 

The O 
award O 
, O 
although O 
far O 
less O 
than O 
the O 
$ O 
10 O 
million O 
, O 
including O 
punitive O 
damages O 
, O 
that O 
Ms. O 
Midler B-PER 
sought O 
, O 
is O 
likely O 
to O 
force O 
Madison O 
Avenue O 
to O 
further O 
rethink O 
how O 
they O 
use O 
famous O 
songs O 
in O

. O 

Ms. O 
Sinatra B-PER 
sued O 
over O 
the O 
use O 
of O 
her O 
`` O

'' O 
song O 
in O

Nonetheless O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Kurnit B-PER 
said O 
that O 
the O 
latest O

are O 
having O 
a O 
chilling O

. O 

Joanne B-PER 
Lipman I-PER

Traders O 
said O 
that O 
statements O 
made O 
over O 
the O 
weekend O 
to O 
quell O 
concern O 
about O 
the O 
stability O 
of O 
Prime O 
Minister O 
Margaret B-PER 
Thatcher I-PER 
's O 
government O 
and O 
the O 
future O 
of O 
her O 
economic O

largely O 
failed O 
to O 
reassure O

and O 
bolster O 
the O 
flagging O 
British O 
unit O 
. O 

At O 
the O 
same O 
time O 
, O 
a O 
recent O 
poll O 
shows O 
that O 
Mrs. O 
Thatcher B-PER 
has O 
hit O 
the O 
lowest O 
popularity O 
rating O 
of O 
any O 
British O 
leader O 
since O

began O 
50 O

Ortega B-PER 
had O 
threatened O 
to O 
end O 
a O 
19 O

old O 
ceasefire O

The O 
law O 
, O 
which O 
Bush B-PER 
allowed O 
to O 
take O

without O

went O 
into O

Friday O

Mr. O

Of O

these O 
turf O

are O 
unseemly O

dangerous O

Mr. O

Mr. O

. O 

We O 
're O 
sorry O 
to O 
see O 
Nigel B-PER 
Lawson I-PER 
's I-PER 
departure O 
from O 
the O 
British O 
government O 
. O 

But O 
in O 
the O 
end O 
his O 
resignation O 
as O 
Chancellor O 
of O 
the O 
Exchequer O 
may O 
be O 
a O 
good O 
thing O 
, O 
especially O 
if O 
it O 
works O 
as O 
he O 
no O 
doubt O 
intends O 
-- O 
by O 
forcing O 
Prime O 
Minister O 
Thatcher B-PER 
and O 
her O 
counterparts O 
elsewhere O 
to O 
confront O 
the O 
genuine O 
intellectual O 
issues O 
involved O 
. O 

At O 
this O 
point O 
, O 
the O 
options O 
were O 
: O 
Crunch O 
money O 
to O 
stop O 
the O 
boost O 
in O 
the O 
aggregates O 
, O 
as O 
Sir O 
Alan B-PER 
surely O 
advised O 
, O 
and O 
forget O 
the O 
soaring O 
pound O 
. O 

Faced O 
with O 
a O 
similar O 
situation O 
, O 
Paul B-PER 
Volcker I-PER 
let O 
the O 
dollar O 
soar O 
, O 
-LRB- O 
though O 
monetary O 
aggregates O 
also O 
grew O 
so O 
rapidly O 
monetarists O 
issued O 
egg O 
- O 
on O 
- O 
the O 
- O 
face O 
warnings O 
of O 
inflation O 
-RRB- O 
. O 

He O 
reaped O 
inflation O 
along O 
with O 
rapid O 
growth O 
, O 
no O 
doubt O 
validating O 
Sir O 
Alan B-PER 
's O 
predictions O 
in O 
the O 
Prime O 
Minister O 
's O 
mind O 
. O 

But O 
more O 
recently O 
, O 
the O 
pound O 
has O 
been O 
falling O 
with O 
high O 
inflation O 
, O 
which O 
has O 
also O 
seemed O 
almost O 
impervious O 
to O 
the O 
high O 
interest O 
rates O 
Mr. O 
Lawson B-PER 
deployed O 
to O 
stop O 
it O 
. O 

We O 
should O 
also O 
add O 
Mr. O 
Lawson B-PER 
's O 
own O 
explanation O 
, O 
as O 
we O 
understand O 
it O 
. O 

Perhaps O 
the O 
fiscal O 
shock O 
of O 
tax O 
cuts O 
is O 
after O 
all O 
best O 
absorbed O 
by O 
floating O 
rates O 
, O 
though O 
of O 
course O 
in O 
the O 
event O 
Mr. O 
Lawson B-PER 
resigned O 
over O 
whether O 
to O 
support O 
a O 
weak O 
pound O 
, O 
not O 
restrain O 
a O 
strong O 
one O 
. O 

The O 
globalists O 
tend O 
to O 
think O 
Mr. O 
Lawson B-PER 
ran O 
onto O 
technical O 
reefs O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Reynolds B-PER 
also O 
notes O 
that O 
since O 
British O 
banks O 
have O 
no O 
reserve O 
requirements O 
, O 
high O 
interest O 
rates O 
are O 
less O 
likely O 
to O 
curb O 
inflation O 
than O 
to O 
cause O 
recession O 
. O 

We O 
would O 
add O 
that O 
in O 
political O 
terms O 
, O 
Mrs. O 
Thatcher B-PER 
's O 
problem O 
was O 
failing O 
to O 
decide O 
between O 
the O 
Chancellor O 
and O 
her O 
adviser O 
. O 

So O 
Mr. O 
Lawson B-PER 
had O 
to O 
resign O 
. O 

In O 
the O 
end O 
his O 
move O 
was O 
sparked O 
by O 
remarks O 
in O 
excerpts O 
from O 
Sir O 
Alan B-PER 
's O 
autobiography O 
in O 
The O 
American O 
Economist O 
, O 
a O 
10,000 O 
- O 
circulation O 
academic O 
journal O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Phillips B-PER 
made O 
his O 
comments O 
during O 
an O 
interview O 
detailing O 
his O 
plans O 
for O 
the O 
agency O 
. O 

Surrounded O 
by O 
stacks O 
of O 
paper O 
, O 
two O 
computers O 
and O 
photos O 
of O 
himself O 
boating O 
and O 
flying O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Phillips B-PER 
laid O 
out O 
several O 
changes O 
he O 
hopes O 
to O 
make O 
at O 
the O 
agency O 
. O 

First O 
and O 
foremost O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Phillips B-PER 
said O 
he O 
hopes O 
to O 
improve O 
client O 
service O 
. O 

And O 
some O 
of O 
its O 
top O 
client O 
- O 
service O 
executives O 
, O 
including O 
Mr. O 
Phillips B-PER 
, O 
were O 
promoted O 
to O 
the O 
point O 
they O 
were O 
saddled O 
with O 
administrative O 
duties O 
, O 
with O 
little O 
time O 
to O 
see O 
clients O 
. O 

But O 
Mr. O 
Phillips B-PER 
recently O 
freed O 
himself O 
up O 
to O 
spend O 
more O 
time O 
with O 
clients O 
by O 
delegating O 
much O 
of O 
his O 
administrative O 
work O 
to O 
a O 
deputy O 
. O 

`` O 
There O 
is O 
little O 
or O 
no O 
integration O 
of O 
our O 
work O 
, O 
quality O 
is O 
spotty O 
, O 
there O 
is O 
no O 
single O 
focus O 
, O 
'' O 
Mr. O 
Phillips B-PER 
complained O 
to O 
staffers O 
in O 
March O 
, O 
when O 
the O 
reorganization O 
was O 
announced O 
. O 

Industry O 
executives O 
and O 
analysts O 
are O 
divided O 
on O 
whether O 
Mr. O 
Phillips B-PER 
is O 
up O 
to O 
the O 
task O 
. O 

He O 
is O 
n't O 
as O 
well O 
- O 
known O 
to O 
clients O 
as O 
is O 
Mr. O 
Roman B-PER 
. O 

The O 
one O 
thing O 
Mr. O 
Phillips B-PER 
clearly O 
does O 
have O 
going O 
for O 
him O 
is O 
continuity O 
, O 
although O 
it O 
is O 
n't O 
certain O 
if O 
that O 
will O 
be O 
enough O 
. O 

He O 
said O 
Mr. O 
Klein B-PER 
will O 
return O 
to O 
his O 
post O 
at O 
the O 
end O 
of O 
the O 
trial O 
`` O 
at O 
which O 
he O 
will O 
be O 
vindicated O 
. O 
'' O 

In O 
a O 
letter O 
to O 
investors O 
, O 
Chairman O 
Edward B-PER 
S. I-PER 
Finkelstein I-PER 
wrote O 
that O 
he O 
expects O 
the O 
company O 
to O 
`` O

and O 
inconsistencies O 
very O 
quickly O

the O 
people O 
who O 
had O 
the O 
skills O

required O 
to O 
resolve O

were O 
part O 
of O 
the O 
task O

, O 
'' O 
Mr. O 
Anton B-PER 
explains O 
. O 

The O 
result O 
was O 
a O 
more O 
thoughtful O 
, O 
complete O 
and O 
competitive O 
proposal O

Mr. O 
Anton B-PER

Werner B-PER 
K. I-PER 
Rey I-PER 
believes O 
fortunes O 
are O 
made O 
by O 
being O 
friendly O

`` O 
I O 
like O 
to O 
succeed O 
, O 
'' O 
says O 
Mr. O 
Rey B-PER 
during O 
a O 
recent O 
morning O 
of O 
working O 
at O 
home O 
, O 
which O 
he O 
also O 
likes O 
. O 

In O 
short O 
: O 
Rey B-PER 
found O 
companies O 
with O 
weak O 
earnings O 
but O 
rich O 
assets O 
. O 
'' O 

However O 
, O 
the O 
Swiss O 
financial O 
press O 
in O 
general O 
, O 
as O 
well O 
as O 
many O 
analysts O 
, O 
have O 
had O 
a O 
hard O 
time O 
making O 
up O 
their O 
minds O 
about O 
Mr. O 
Rey B-PER 
and O 
his O 
un-Swiss O 
ways O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Rey B-PER 
made O 
50 O 
million O 
Swiss O 
francs O 
on O 
the O 
sale O 
. O 

Buying O 
from O 
willing O 
shareholders O 
makes O 
an O 
unfriendly O 
takeover O 
impossible O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Rey B-PER 
contends O 
. O 

Nevertheless O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Rey B-PER 
has O 
been O 
very O 
careful O 
since O 
then O 
to O 
make O 
sure O 
his O 
moves O 
are O 
welcome O 
. O 

But O 
Mr. O 
Rey B-PER 
brought O 
about O 
a O 
merger O 
in O 
the O 
next O 
few O 
years O 
between O 
the O 
country O 
's O 
major O 
producers O 
; O 
the O 
increased O 
efficiency O 
has O 
perked O 
up O 
the O 
industry O 
. O 

Financial O 
analysts O 
note O 
that O 
Mr. O 
Rey B-PER 
is O 
attracted O 
to O 
companies O 
that O 
are O 
undervalued O 
on O 
the O 
basis O 
of O 
their O 
real O 
- O 
estate O 
interests O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Rey B-PER 
says O 
the O 
move O 
is O 
yet O 
another O 
example O 
of O 
his O 
conservatism O 
. O 

`` O 
I O 
do O 
n't O 
want O 
to O

been O 
successful O

'' O 
Mr. O 
Rubel B-PER 
said O

If O

weatherman O 
gets O 
butterflies O 
facing O 
the O

again O 
after O 
a O 
questionable O 
forecast O 
, O 
Donald B-PER 
H. I-PER 
Straszheim I-PER 
surely O 
understands O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Straszheim B-PER 
expects O 
he O 
will O 
take O 
some O 
heat O 
, O 
and O 
he O 
's O 
right O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Bostian B-PER 
said O 
in O 
August O 
that O 
his O 
macroeconomic O 
index O 
signaled O 
recession O 
. O 

`` O 
My O 
own O 
personal O 
opinion O 
is O 
that O 
Don B-PER 
threw O 
in O 
the O 
towel O

about O 
the O 
time O 
he O 
should O 
have O 
doubled O 
his O 
bet O 
, O 
'' O 
he O 
says O 
. O 

And O 
Mr. O 
Straszheim B-PER 
conceded O 
after O 
a O 
recent O 
drop O 
in O 
manufacturing O 
jobs O 
that O 
`` O 
it O 
may O 
prove O 
to O 
be O 
the O 
case O

Carrying O 
the O 
new O 
message O 
on O 
the O 
road O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Straszheim B-PER 
meets O 
confrontation O 
that O 
often O 
occurs O 
in O 
inverse O 
proportion O 
to O 
the O 
size O 
of O 
the O 
client O 
. O 

Is O 
that O 
the O 
forecast O 
? O 
'' O 
Mr. O 
O'Brien B-PER 
asks O 
, O 
trying O 
to O 
pin O 
down O 
the O 
economist O 
. O 

He O 
does O 
n't O 
fully O 
succeed O 
, O 
although O 
Mr. O 
Straszheim B-PER 
lists O 
an O 
array O 
of O 
interest O

rate O 
scenarios O 
. O 

Swiveling O 
in O 
his O 
chair O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Straszheim B-PER 
replies O 
that O 
the O 
new O 
outlook O 
, O 
though O 
still O 
weak O 
, O 
does O 
n't O 
justify O 
calling O

right O 
now O 
. O 
`` O 

One O 
of O 
Mr. O 
Straszheim B-PER 
's O 
recurring O 
themes O 
is O 
that O 
the O

Straszheim B-PER 
snaps O 
in O 
a O 
rare O 
show O 
of O 
irritation O 
. O 

Explaining O 
his O 
change O 
of O 
mind O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Straszheim B-PER 
says O 
later O 
, O 
`` O 
It O

Mr. O

fidgeting O 
with O

on O 
this O

The O 
British O 
press O 
, O 
making O 
a O 
mountain O 
out O 
of O 
a O 
molehill O 
, O 
precipitated O 
an O 
unnecessary O 
economic O 
crisis O 
by O 
portraying O 
Mrs. O 
Thatcher B-PER 
as O 
an O 
autocrat O 
who O 
had O 
thrown O 
economic O 
policy O 
into O 
confusion O 
by O 
driving O 
a O 
respected O 
figure O 
from O 
her O 
government O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Lawson B-PER

his O 
European O

minded O 
colleagues O

formally O 
tied O 
to O 
the O 
West O 
German O 
mark O 
. O 

Sir O 
Alan B-PER 
considers O 
this O 
an O 
ill O 
- O 
advised O 
and O 
costly O 
policy O 
. O 

Until O 
his O 
resignation O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Lawson B-PER 
had O 
been O 
conducting O 
British O 
monetary O 
policy O 
as O 
if O 
the O 
pound O 
were O 
tied O 
to O 
the O 
mark O 
. O 

As O 
a O 
result O 
, O 
he O 
reignited O 
the O 
inflation O 
that O 
Mrs. O 
Thatcher B-PER 
, O 
through O 
a O 
long O 
and O 
costly O 
effort O 
, O 
had O 
subdued O

To O 
keep O 
the O 
exchange O 
rate O 
pegged O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Lawson B-PER 
tightened O 
monetary O 
policy O 
and O 
pushed O 
interest O 
rates O 
up O 
to O 
15 O 
% O 
. O 

This O 
put O 
Mrs. O 
Thatcher B-PER 
in O 
a O 
bind O 
. O 

Edouard B-PER 
Balladur I-PER 
, O

the O 
time O 
, O 
was O 
sold O 
on O 
the O 
tax O 
- O 
cut O 
policy O 
but O 
was O 
concerned O 
that O 
his O 
government O 
would O 
be O 
criticized O 
as O 
anti-European O 
for O 
disturbing O 
the O 
linked O 
European O 
currency O 
relationship O 
. O 

To O 
avoid O 
this O 
deficit O 
Mr. O 
Lawson B-PER 
inflated O 
the O 
pound O 
in O 
order O 
to O 
prevent O 
its O 
rise O 
. O 

Nigel B-PER 
Lawson I-PER 
was O 
a O 
victim O 
of O 
the O 
immense O 
confusion O 
in O 
thought O 
that O 
has O 
been O 
characteristic O 
of O 
Western O 
financial O 
circles O 
during O 
the O 
1980s O 
. O 

This O 
policy O 
is O 
totally O 
mindless O 
, O 
and O 
Sir O 
Alan B-PER 
is O 
correct O 
to O 
point O 
out O 
its O 
deficiencies O

Thatcher I-PER 
's I-PER 
instinctive O 
response O

down O

It O 
sounds O 
like O 
the O 
work O 
of O 
a O 
decade O 
, O

the O 
deadline O 
is O 
late O

expected O 
to O 
call O

`` O

replies O 
Mr. O

then O 
asks O

`` O

So O 
far O 
, O 
Mr. O

badly O 
wants O

has O 
long O 
called O 
for O 
a O

Still O 
, O 
Mr. O

. O 

More O 
provocatively O 
, O 
some O 
conservative O 
legal O 
theorists O 
have O 
begun O 
arguing O 
that O 
Mr. O

does O 
n't O 
need O 
to O 
wait O 
for O 
a O 
law O 
giving O 
him O 
the O 
veto O

the O 
power O 
already O 
is O 
implicit O 
in O 
the O

Still O 
, O 
proponents O 
contend O 
that O

would O 
have O

Rep. O

with O 
the O 
Big O

since O 
he O 
took O

it O 
was O 
time O 
for O

But O 
Mr. O

said O

should O 
slash O

between O 
15 O

30 O 
days O

reduce O

Even O 
before O

broadside O 
, O 
some O 
large O 
dealers O 
said O

Compare O 
the O 
Bush B-PER 
request O 
to O 
what O 
the O 
Senators O 
gave O 
themselves O 
: O 

In O 
a O 
remark O 
someone O 
should O 
remember O

, O 
`` O

five O

Some O 
of O 
the O 
projects O 
being O 
funded O 
by O 
the O

are O 
the O 
first O 
fruits O 
of O 
Mr. O 
Gandhi B-PER 
's O 
policy O 
, O 
and O 
they O 
require O 
more O 
capital O 
than O 
the O 
smaller O 
industrial O 
units O 
built O 
in O 
the O 
past O

Some O 
companies O 
are O 
raising O

Mr. O

the O

one O

Another O

that O

No O

, O 
Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
has O 
been O 
a O 
calming O 
influence O 
. O 

Rather O 
than O 
scaring O 
off O 
white O 
voters O 
, O 
as O 
many O 
predicted O 
he O 
would O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
attracted O 
many O 
whites O 
precisely O 
because O 
of O 
his O 
reputation O 
for O 
having O 
a O 
cool O 
head O 
. O

Keeping O 
cool O 
is O 
a O 
Dinkins B-PER 
priority O 
: O 
On O 
humid O 
days O 
this O 
summer O 
, O 
he O 
was O 
known O 
to O 
change O 
his O 
double O 
- O 
breasted O 
suits O 
as O 
many O 
as O 
four O 
times O 
a O

. O 
-RRB- O 

Over O 
the O 
last O 
few O 
weeks O 
, O 
he O 
has O 
frittered O 
away O 
roughly O 
half O 
of O 
what O 
was O 
once O 
a O 
33 O 
- O 
point O 
lead O 
in O 
the O 
polls O 
over O 
Mr. O 
Giuliani B-PER 
. O 

His O 
campaign O 
was O 
caught O 
flat O 
- O 
footed O 
amid O 
allegations O 
it O 
paid O 
almost O 
$ O 
10,000 O 
for O 
what O 
it O 
said O 
was O 
a O 
`` O

'' O 
effort O 
by O 
black O 
activist O 
Sonny B-PER 
Carson I-PER 
, O 
a O 
convicted O 
kidnapper O 
who O 
later O 
said O 
publicly O 
that O 
he O 
is O 
`` O 
anti-white O 
. O 
'' O 

These O 
campaign O 
problems O 
have O 
echoed O 
difficulties O 
Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
has O 
run O 
into O 
before O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
lost O 
twice O 
by O 
wide O 
margins O 
before O 
finally O 
getting O 
elected O 
borough O 
president O 
in O 
1985 O 
. O 

Colleagues O 
today O 
recall O 
with O 
some O 
humor O 
how O 
meetings O 
would O 
crawl O 
into O 
the O 
early O 
morning O 
hours O 
as O 
Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
would O 
march O 
his O 
staff O 
out O 
of O 
board O 
meetings O 
and O 
into O 
his O 
private O 
office O 
to O 
discuss O 
, O 
en O 
masse O 
, O 
certain O 
controversial O 
proposals O 
. O 

`` O

give O

that O 
, O 
'' O 
says O 
Deputy O 
Mayor O 
Robert B-PER 
Esnard I-PER 
. O 

Often O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
's O 
procrastination O 
prevented O 
him O 
from O 
having O 
a O 
say O 
in O 
the O 
way O 
things O 
turned O 
out O 
, O 
critics O 
claim O 
. O 

`` O 
We O 
did O 
n't O 
rubber O 
- O 
stamp O 
everything O 
that O 
came O 
to O 
us O 
, O 
'' O 
Mr. O 
Lynch B-PER 
says O 
. O 

On O 
some O 
occasions O 
when O 
Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
has O 
discussed O 
the O 
issues O 
during O 
the O 
campaign O 
, O 
he O 
has O 
run O 
into O 
a O 
familiar O 
kind O 
of O 
trouble O 
. O 

Some O 
supporters O 
were O 
stunned O 
this O 
summer O 
when O 
Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
suggested O 
weakening O 
the O 
law O 
forbidding O 
public O 
employees O 
to O 
go O 
on O 
strike O 
. O 

When O 
he O 
later O 
sided O 
with O 
striking O 
hospital O 
workers O 
, O 
some O 
allies O 
cringed O 
a O 
little O 
more O 
, O 
concerned O 
that O 
Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
was O 
setting O 
the O 
wrong O 
tone O 
for O 
coming O 
contract O 
negotiations O 
with O 
city O 
employees O 
. O 

Then O 
, O 
two O 
days O 
before O 
receiving O 
an O 
endorsement O 
from O 
environmental O 
groups O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
promised O 
he O 
would O 
issue O 
a O 
three O 
- O 
year O 
moratorium O 
on O 
construction O 
of O 
garbage O 
- O 
incinerator O 
plants O 
. O 

While O 
his O 
public O 
statements O 
have O 
at O 
times O 
been O 
confusing O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
's O 
position O 
papers O 
have O 
more O 
consistently O 
reflected O 
anti-development O 
sentiment O 
. O 

But O 
Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
's O 
economic O 
planks O 
do O 
n't O 
seem O 
to O 
bother O 
the O 
business O 
community O 
, O 
where O 
he O 
draws O 
significant O 
support O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
's O 
inner O 
circle O 
of O 
advisers O 
appears O 
to O 
include O 
both O 
ideologues O 
and O 
pragmatists O 
, O 
leaving O 
voters O 
with O 
little O 
clue O 
as O 
to O 
who O 
will O 
be O 
more O 
influential O 
. O 

The O 
key O 
man O 
seems O 
to O 
be O 
the O 
campaign O 
manager O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Lynch B-PER 
. O 

If O 
she O 
remains O 
influential O 
with O 
Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
, O 
as O 
some O 
suggest O 
she O 
will O 
, O 
his O 
mayoralty O 
may O 
take O 
on O 
a O 
more O 
anti-development O 
flavor O 
. O 

Some O 
business O 
leaders O 
and O 
others O 
also O 
believe O 
that O 
Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
would O 
place O 
significant O 
responsibility O 
in O 
the O 
hands O 
of O 
a O 
deputy O 
mayor O 
with O 
a O 
strong O 
administrative O 
background O 
. O 

`` O 
If O 
any O 
of O 
us O 
think O 
we O 
're O 
going O 
to O 
sidetrack O 
David B-PER 
's O 
determination O 
to O 
be O 
the O 
best O 
possible O 
mayor O 
because O 
of O 
his O 
obligations O 
to O 
us O 
, O 
we O 
are O 
making O 
a O 
sad O 
mistake O 
. O 
'' O 

But O 
Mr. O 
Dinkins B-PER 
's O 
sense O 
of O 
pragmatism O 
often O 
comes O 
across O 
more O 
as O 
an O 
insider O 
's O 
determination O 
not O 
to O 
upset O 
the O 
political O 
apple O 
cart O 
. O 

As O 
a O 
Republican O 
in O 
an O 
overwhelmingly O 
Democratic O 
city O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Giuliani B-PER 
has O 
an O 
inherent O 
handicap O 
. O 

`` O 
The O 
bottom O 
line O 
is O 
that O 
he O 
is O 
a O 
very O 
genuine O 
and O 
decent O 
guy O 
, O 
'' O 
says O 
Malcolm B-PER 
Hoenlein I-PER 
, O 
a O 
Jewish O 
community O 
leader O 
. O 

Toni B-PER 
Johnson I-PER 
pulls O 
a O 
tape O 
measure O 
across O 
the O 
front O 
of O 
what O 
was O 
once O 
a O 
stately O 
Victorian O 
home O 
. O 

The O 
Victorian O 
house O 
that O 
Ms. O 
Johnson B-PER 
is O 
inspecting O 
has O 
been O 
deemed O 
unsafe O 
by O 
town O 
officials O 
. O 

A O 
few O 
years O 
ago O 
, O 
Mrs. O 
Hammack B-PER 
insisted O 
on O 
buying O 
earthquake O 
insurance O 
for O 
this O 
house O 
, O 
which O 
had O 
been O 
converted O 
into O 
apartments O 
. O 

The O 
next O 
day O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Schaeffer B-PER 
presented O 
the O 
couple O 
with O 
a O 
check O 
for O 
$ O 
151,000 O 
to O 
help O 
them O 
build O 
a O 
new O 
home O 
in O 
the O 
same O 
neighborhood O 
. O 

But O 
such O 
skills O 
were O 
alien O 
to O 
Toni B-PER 
Johnson I-PER 
. O 

The O 
next O 
day O 
, O 
as O 
she O 
prepares O 
a O 
$ O 
10,000 O 
check O 
for O 
the O 
Hammacks B-PER 
, O 
which O 
will O 
cover O 
the O 
cost O 
of O 
demolishing O 
the O 
house O 
and O 
clearing O 
away O 
the O 
debris O 
, O 
she O 
jumps O 
at O 
the O 
slightest O 
noise O 
. O 

On O 
further O 
reflection O 
, O 
she O 
admits O 
that O 
venturing O 
inside O 
the O 
Hammacks B-PER 
' O 
house O 
the O 
previous O 
day O 
was O 
n't O 
`` O 
such O 
a O 
great O 
idea O 
. O 
'' O 

Ms. O 
Johnson B-PER 
tells O 
them O 
that O 
, O 
if O 
the O 
appliances O 
ca O 
n't O 
be O 
salvaged O 
, O 
their O 
policy O 
covers O 
the O 
replacement O

`` O 
And O 
you O 
did O

want O 
me O 
to O

says O 
Mrs. O 
Hammack B-PER 
, O 
reaching O 
across O 
the O 
table O 
and O 
gently O 
tapping O 
his O 
hand O 
. O 

Even O 
Ms. O 
Johnson B-PER 
herself O 
made O 
that O 
assumption O 
. O 

For O 
Ms. O 
Johnson B-PER 
, O 
dealing O 
with O 
the O 
earthquake O 
has O 
been O 
more O 
than O 
just O 
a O 
work O 
experience O 
. O 

`` O 
We O 
worry O 
about O

out O

Last O 
Sunday O

uncertainties O 
about O

Everyone O 
was O 
extremely O 
long O 
on O 
sterling O 
, O 
'' O 
Mr. O 
Beale B-PER 
said O

analysts O 
had O 
much O 
good O 
to O 
say O 
about O 
the O

despite O 
the O 
fact O 
that O

anticipate O 
a O 
shift O 
in O 
Mrs. O 
Thatcher B-PER

economic O 
policies O 
. O 

The O 
market O 
closed O 
prior O 
to O 
Mr. O 
Lawson B-PER 
's O 
announcement O 
. O 

It O 
's O 
ironic O 
that O 
David B-PER 
Boren I-PER 
should O 
be O 
in O 
the O 
center O 
of O

mire O 
. O 

If O 
this O 
were O 
1949 O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Boren B-PER 
might O 
even O 
succeed O 
. O 

But O 
even O 
Mr. O 
Boren B-PER 
defends O 
congressional O 
oversight O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Boren B-PER 
is O 
confusing O

principles O 
with O 
agreement O 
on O

it O

Mr. O

Mr. O 
Morishita B-PER

Not O 
many O

the O

of O 
Mr. O 
Morishita B-PER

business O 
, O 
but O 
it O 
's O 
a O

of O

up O

often O 
quick O 
to O

Mr. O 
Morishita B-PER 
scoffs O 
at O 
those O 
stories O 
, O 
as O 
well O 
as O 
the O 
ones O 
connecting O 
him O

Although O 
Mr. O

says O 
little O 
about O 
his O

he O 
offers O 
one O 
rule O 
to O 
success O 
: O 
Never O 
gamble O 
too O 
far O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Morishita B-PER
