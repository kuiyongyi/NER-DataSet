At O

the O

, O 
besides O 
affecting O 
the O

has O 
another O

running O 
roughly O

this O 
suggests O 
that O 
after O 
the O

there O 
may O 
be O 
a O 
restructuring O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC

On O 
the O

President O 
Lee B-PER 
Teng I-PER

of O 
the O

have O 
argued O 
that O 
Taiwan B-LOC

stock O 
market O 
is O 
too O 
vulnerable O 
to O 
cross-strait O

and O 
this O

will O 
enable O 
the O

stabilize O

thus O 
domestic O 
morale O 
- O 
in O 
the O

of O

like O 
the O 
1996 O

Around O

Now O 
with O

the O 
intermingling O

nothing O

400 O

the O

That O

Last O

How O

that O

The O

very O 
excited O

Moreover O 
, O 
the O

Consider O 
, O 
says O

the O 
fact O 
that O

their O 
potential O

That O 
one O 
brief O

destined O

So O 
this O 
is O 
still O 
just O 
a O 
political O 
debating O 
point O 
, O 
and O 
it O 
is O 
too O 
early O 
to O

In O 
the O 
past O

merely O 
played O

now O 
the O

Maintaining O

" O 

This O

because O 
over O

a O 
consensus O

If O

whose O

it O

now O

" O

had O 
to O 
learn O

once O

suffering O 
. O 

Indeed O 
, O 
says O 
Joanne B-PER 
Chang I-PER 
, O 
it O 
is O 
precisely O 
because O

Advanced O

the O

, O 
but O 
continuing O

is O 
nothing O 
new O 
among O 
Taiwan B-LOC

universities O 
. O 

In O 
1984 O 
, O 
the O 
two O

signed O 
an O 
agricultural O

Taiwan B-LOC

a O 
technical O

there O 
. O 

Last O 
year O 
, O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
hottest O 
stocks O 
was O 
Quanta B-ORG

, O 
which O 
reached O 
800 O

In O 
his O 
view O 
, O 
there O 
is O 
much O 
that O 
we O

from O

including O 
its O

The O 
IRA B-ORG 
has O 
pointed O 
out O 
, O 
for O 
example O 
, O 
that O 
MJIB B-ORG 
investigators O 
often O 
receive O 
oral O 
instructions O 
from O 
the O 
NSB O 
to O 
collect O 
information O 
on O 
a O 
particular O 
political O 
party O 
. O 

Chen B-PER 
Wen I-PER 
- I-PER 
cheng I-PER 
says O 
that O 
a O 
Chen B-PER 
victory O 
would O 
have O 
its O 
greatest O 
impact O 
on O 
the B-ORG 
New I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
- O 
and O 
that O 
the O 
effect O 
would O 
be O 
positive O 
. O 

Another O 
point O 
they O 
agree O 
on O 
is O 
that O 
not O 
enough O 
was O 
done O 
in O 
the O 
past O 
to O 
develop O 
ties O 
between O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
and O 
Macau B-LOC 
, O 
but O 
that O 
with O 
Macau B-LOC 
's O 
change O 
of O 
status O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
corresponding O 
change O 
in O

The O 
Group B-ORG 
entered O 
the O 
final O 
phase O 
of O 
discussions O 
on O 
the O 
" O 
one O 
China B-LOC

issue O 
during O 
November O 
, O 
but O 
differences O 
between O 
pro-unification O 
and O 
pro-independence O 
participants O 
continued O 
to O 
stymie O 
the O 
effort O 
to O 
produce O 
a O 
statement O 
acceptable O 
to O 
all O 
. O 

If O 
Soong B-PER 
wins O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
considered O 
virtually O 
inevitable O 
that O 
his O 
supporters O 
will O 
organize O 
some O 
sort O 
of O 
political O 
organization O 
. O 

Even O 
if O 
he O 
wins O 
, O 
this O 
may O 
mean O 
only O 
that O 
the O 
people O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
are O 
willing O 
to O 
give O 
Lien B-PER 
Chan I-PER 
a O 
chance O 
, O 
and O 
would O 
not O 
necessarily O 
be O 
an O 
endorsement O 
of O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
itself O 
. O 

" O 
Chen B-PER 
dares O 
to O 
talk O 
about O 
the O

, O

one O 
of O 
these O

Another O 
significant O 
possibility O 
is O 
that O 
New B-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
members O 
, O 
who O 
tend O 
to O 
support O 
James B-PER 
Soong I-PER 
, O 
could O

the O

UDN B-ORG

Biung I-ORG 
, O 
the O 
company O 
that O 
publishes O 
Biung O 
, O 
who O 
has O 
many O 
years O 
of O 
experience O 
in O 
publishing O 
, O 
says O 
that O 
there O 
is O 
a O 
limit O 
to O 
how O 
many O 
people O 
are O 
reached O 
by O 
classified O 
advertising O 
. O 

Many O 
firms O 
moved O 
production O 
to O 
mainland O 
China B-LOC 
or O 
Southeast B-LOC 
Asia I-LOC 
, O 
and O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
remaining O 
domestic O 
textile O 
industry O 
was O 
dramatically O 
reshuffled O 
. O 

Although O 
pro-Beijing O 
elements O 
prevail O 
in O 
Macau B-LOC 
, O 
the O 
former O 
Portuguese O 
administration O 
did O 
n't O 
seem O 
too O 
bothered O 
about O 
PRC B-ORG 
pressure O 
when O 
it O 
came O 
to O 
the O 
issue O 
of O 
ties O 
with O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
, O 
perhaps O 
because O 
their O 
only O 
concern O 
was O 
for O 
people O 
's O 
livelihood O 
. O 

In O 
working O 
together O 
on O 
the O 
recovery O 
effort O 
, O 
the O 
people O 
of O 
Peipu B-LOC 
and O 
Shihkang B-LOC 
have O 
built O 
up O 
close O 
personal O 
ties O 
. O 

For O 
the O 
past O 
two O 
years O 
, O 
however O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
has O 
been O 
open O 
to O 
imported O 
beef O 
, O 
and O 
Yoshinoya B-ORG 
has O 
done O 
very O 
well O 
. O 

Despite O 
the O 
interest B-ORG 
generated B-ORG 
among B-ORG 
calligraphers I-ORG 
by O 
these B-ORG 
innovations I-ORG 
, O 
Wang O 
was O 
more O 
suited O 
by O 
temperament O 
to O 
the O 
established O 
forms O 
, O 
and O 
he O 
eventually O 
turned O 
back O 
to O 
ancients O 
for O 
inspiration O 
. O 

The O 
possibility O 
of O 
a O 
constitutional O 
crisis O 
looks O 
much O 
greater O 
under O 
Soong B-PER 
than O 
under O 
Chen B-PER 
Shui I-PER 
- I-PER 
bian I-PER 
or O 
Lien B-PER 
Chan I-PER 
. O 

But O 
the O 
people O 
's O 
primary O 
concern O 
was O 
whether O 
or O 
not O 
the O 
incoming O 
SAR B-ORG 
administration O 
would O 
be O 
capable O 
of O 
tackling O 
difficult O 
problems O 
left O 
behind O 
by O 
the O 
Portuguese O 
, O 
particularly O 
economic O 
recession O 
and O 
declining O 
public O 
order O 
. O 

Justice O 
Tung B-PER

pointed O 
that O 
legislation O 
barring O 
construction O 
of O 
the O 
nuclear O 
power O 
plant O 
had O 
already O 
been O 
passed O 
twice O 
before O 
by O 
the O 
legislature O 
, O 
and O 
was O 
successfully O 
vetoed O 
each O 
time O 
by O 
the O 
previous O 
Kuomintang B-ORG 
administration O
