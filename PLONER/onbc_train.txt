Koizumi B-PER

right O 
now O 
I O

I O 
told O 
him O 
: O 
Mr. O 
Fouad B-PER 
Siniora I-PER 
, O 
Prime O

by O 
God O 
it O 
is O 
a O

a O 
disgrace O 
that O 
you O

you O 
give O 
us O 
two O

either O 
to O

Certainly O

it O

Dobson B-PER

numerous O

Some O 
analysts O 
also O 
mentioned O 
this O 
point O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
right O 
now O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC

neighboring O 
countries O 
are O 
basically O 
very O 
much O 
disappointed O 
with O 
what O 
Koizumi B-PER

been O 
doing O

And O 
later O 
we O

got O

Well O 
, O 
the O 
heads O 
of O 
several O

, O 
the B-ORG

the B-ORG 
Japan I-ORG

, O 
all O 
had O 
frequent O 
direct O 
meetings O 
with O 
Koizumi B-PER 
, O 
strongly O 
cautioning O 
him O 
not O 
to O 
visit O 
Yasukuni O

, O 
Uh-huh O 
. O 
Uh-huh O

because O 
our O

suffer O

our O 
Japan B-LOC

not O 
survive O 
in O 
the O

And O 
some O 
Democrats O 
said O 
the O 
president O

action O 
is O 
a O 
stick O 
in O 
the O 
eye O 
just O 
as O 
the O

preparing O

and O 
this O 
goes O 
beyond O

I O 
have O 
seen O 
a O

These O

are O 
doing O 
something O

is O 
quite O 
unknown O

at O

this O

exactly O 
what O 
I O 
want O 
at O

and O 
uh O 
I O 
was O 
on O 
loan O 
to O 
uh O 
Agnew B-PER 
for O 
that O 
speech O 
/. O 

The O 
Senate B-ORG 
's O 
constitutional O 
role O 
of O 
advise O

consent O 
is O 
rapidly O 
disintegrating O 
into O

For O 
that O 
purpose O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
now O 
seriously O 
investigating O

So O 
uh O 
his O 
defense O 
or O 
the O 
defense O 
that O 
Canseco B-PER 
offered O 
on O 
this O

therefore O 
he O

guilty O

How O 
do O 
you O 
in O

and O 
one O

I O 
do O

think O 
we O 
can O 
talk O

So O 
, O 
contrary O 
to O 
Koizumi B-PER 
's O 
diplomatic O 
purpose O 
, O 
he O 
not O 
only O 
failed O 
to O 
sidestep O 
the O 
issue O 
of O 
the O

rather O 
exposed O

Doctor O 
Zuhair B-PER 
, O 
do O 
you O 
expect O 
this O

be O 
any O 
different O 
from O 
previous O

? O 

Well O 
, O 
many O 
countries O 
have O 
all O 
abandoned O 
their O 
hopes O 
to O 
further O 
mend O 
their O

But O 
first O 
Senator O 
McConnell B-PER 
and O 
Senator O

welcome O 
both O 
/. O 

No O 
I O 
think O 
uh O 
the O 
administration O 
should O 
follow O 
the O 
guideline O 
that O 
the B-ORG 
Supreme I-ORG

has O 
suggested O 
which O 
is O 
go O 
to O 
Congress B-ORG

get O 
some O 
kind O 
of O 
solid O 
guidelines O 
on O 
what O 
should O 
happen O 
/. O 

Schmidt B-PER

Hackett B-PER

criticism O 
of O

And O 
I O 
think O 
Ms. O 
Morgan B-PER 
is O 
really O 
insulting O 
all O 
the O

've O 
been O 
there O

by O 
going O

casual O

outside O

a O 
full O

Well O 
, O 
at O 
the O

with O 
respect O 
to O

during O 
the O

8.2 O

if O

what O

happened O 
here O

there O

such O

the O

infinite O

that O
