What O

that O

on O 
making O 
a O 
crack O 
in O 
the O

considered O 
that O 
the O 
door O 
is O 
open O 
for O 
meetings O

all O

, O 
because O 
the O

the O

Mr. O

called O 
him O 
a O

wanted O

implicate O

He O 
did O 
have O 
an O 
option O 
of O 
appealing O 
to O 
the B-ORG

frankly O 
this O 
is O 
a O 
more O 
likely O 
and O 
a O 
faster O 
way O 
to O 
freedom O 
, O 
I O 
would O 
say O 
, O 
because O 
going O

going O 
to O 
take O 
months O

So O 
yes O 
I O 
think O 
there O 
is O 
a O 
lot O

, O 
our O

therefore O
