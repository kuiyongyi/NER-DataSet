the O

Another O 
way O 
people O 
in O

can O 
actively O 
participate O

that O

This O

the O

But O 
he O 
does O 
not O 
see O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
independence O 
as O 
the O 
main O 
flashpoint O 
. O 

This O 
year O 
, O 
Acer B-ORG 
Group I-ORG 
chairman O 
Stan B-PER 
Shih I-PER 
will O 
be O 
a O 
guest O 
lecturer O 
at O 
the O 
university O 
. O 

Though O 
afflicted O 
with O 
Parkinson B-PER 
's O 
disease O 
in O 
his O 
later O 
years O 
, O 
he O 
nonetheless O 
served O 
as O 
vice O 
president O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Academia I-ORG 
Sinica I-ORG 
. O 

If O 
elected O 
, O 
Soong B-PER 
will O 
have O 
a O 
wealth O 
of O 
government O 
resources O 
with O 
which O 
to O 
attract O 
even O 
more O 
people O 
to O 
openly O 
support O 
him O 
, O 
and O 
this O 
could O 
be O 
the O 
straw O 
that O 
breaks O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
's O 
back O 
. O 

The B-ORG 
Ministry I-ORG 
of I-ORG 
Justice I-ORG 
, O 
in O 
the O 
meantime O 
, O 
repeatedly O 
calls O 
upon O 
the O 
MJIB B-ORG 
to O 
stop O 
doing O 
work O 
not O 
related O 
to O 
national O 
security O 
or O 
crime O 
prevention O 
, O 
and O 
demands O 
that O 
they O 
maintain O 
strict O 
political O 
neutrality O 
. O 

Chia B-PER 
recalls O 
that O 
in O 
the O 
1960s O 
, O 
people O 
were O 
too O 
poor O 
to O 
have O 
any O 
money O 
to O 
manage O 
; O 
there O 
were O 
also O 
fears O 
of O 
war O 
, O 
and O 
so O 
any O 
money O 
people O 
did O 
have O 
they O 
quickly O 
exchanged O 
for O 
gold O 
or O 
US B-LOC 
dollars O 
on O 
the O 
black O 
market O 
. O 

He O 
represents O 
the O 
continuation O 
of O 
Kuomintang B-ORG 
tradition O 
. O 

Thick O 
Fog O 
, O 
Dark O 
Clouds O 
is O 
the O 
story O 
of O 
innocent O 
, O 
helpless O 
victims O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
turbulent O 
history O 
. O 

Platinum B-ORG 
is O 
still O 
going O 
, O 
run O 
by O 
senior O 
recording O 
engineer O 
Yeh B-PER

is O

But O 
, O 
given O 
the O 
term O 
system O 
for O 
the O 
chairmanship O 
of O 
the O 
KMT B-ORG 
, O 
after O 
the O 
election O 
there O 
will O 
be O 
a O 
period O 
of O 
time O 
in O 
which O 
Lee B-PER 
remains O 
party O 
chairman O 
, O 
while O 
Lien B-PER 
is O 
president O 
. O 

Now O 
the O 
children O 
of O 
Chinese O 
women O 
and O 
foreign O 
men O 
will O 
also O 
be O 
entitled O 
to O 
ROC B-LOC 
nationality O 
-LRB- O 
as O 
the O 
children O 
of O 
Chinese O 
men O 
and O 
foreign O 
women O 
always O 
have O 
been O 
-RRB- O 
, O 
thus O 
realizing O 
equal O 
treatment O 
under O 
the O 
law O 
for O 
men O 
and O 
women O 
. O 

This O 
in O 
fact O 
has O 
been O 
a O 
chronic O 
problem O 
of O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
dramatic O 
serials O 
. O 
" O 

Mrs. O 
Chang B-PER 
's O 
brother O 
's O 
family O 
is O 
stuck O 
with O 
a O 
heavy O 
mortgage O 
, O 
and O 
there O 
are O 
constant O 
recriminations O 
between O 
Mrs. O 
Chang B-PER 
and O 
her O 
nieces O 
and O 
nephews. O 

Generally O 
speaking O 
, O 
the O 
participants O 
are O 
very O 
interested O 
in O 
Taiwan B-LOC 
's O 
high O 
- O 
tech O 
industries O 
and O 
products O 
. O 

Perhaps O 
the O 
millennium O 
year O 
was O 
a O 
decisive O 
one O 
for O 
the O 
trees O 
, O 
for O 
the B-ORG 
Executive I-ORG 
Yuan I-ORG 
allocated O 
new O 
funds O 
to O 
the O 
VACRS B-ORG 
so O 
that O 
it O 
no O 
longer O 
needs O 
to O 
cut O 
down O 
trees O 
to O 
bolster O 
its O 
finances O 
, O 
and O 
also O 
approved O 
a O 
plan O 
to O 
set O 
up O 
a O 
national O 
park O 
. O 

As O 
Mei B-PER 
explains O 
, O 
there O 
are O 
plenty O 
of O 
old O 
Portuguese O 
texts O 
preserved O 
in O 
Macau B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
the O 
university O 
has O 
a O 
sizeable O 
contingent O 
of O 
Portuguese O 
- O 
speaking O 
professors O 
. O 

Second O 
, O 
in O 
them O 
Huang B-PER 
had O 
moved O 
away O 
from O 
his O 
greatest O 
strength O 
, O 
the O 
characters O 
and O 
settings O 
with O 
which O 
he O 
was O 
truly O 
familiar O 
. O 

Therefore O 
when O 
Professor O 
Peng B-PER 
invited O 
me O 
to O 
attend O 
, O 
I O 
agreed O 
to O 
join O 
the O 
delegation O 
as O 
an O 
advisor O 
to O 
the O 
league O 
. O 

One O 
example O 
was O

The B-ORG 
Five I-ORG 
Flower I-ORG 
Petals I-ORG 
, O 
" O 
a O

" O 
Puli B-LOC

let O 
me O 
go O

Most O 
important O 
were O 
revelations O 
about O

held O
