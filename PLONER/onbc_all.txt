Joining O 
us O 
live O 
from O 
Jeddah B-LOC 
is O 
Doctor O 
Zuhair B-PER 
Al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Harithy I-PER 
, O 
the O 
writer O 
and O 
researcher O 
on O 
political O 
issues O 
. O 

Doctor O 
Zuhair B-PER 
, O 
do O 
you O 
expect O 
this O 
summit O 
to O 
be O 
any O 
different O 
from O 
previous O 
summits O 
? O 

And O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
I O 
also O 
relate O 
what O 
you O 
said O 
about O 
the O 
speech O 
of O 
the O 
Custodian O 
of O 
the B-LOC 
Two I-LOC 
Holy I-LOC 
Shrines I-LOC 
today O 
, O 
which O 
was O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
unconventional O 
and O 
revealed O 
that O 
there O 
is O 
actually O 
a O 
serious O 
desire O 
to O 
come O 
out O 
with O 
complementary O 
resolutions O 
that O 
would O 
benefit O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
the O 
Council B-ORG 
states O 
and O 
their O 
peoples O 
. O 

I O 
mean O 
, O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
the O 
Council B-ORG 
's O 
stance O 
on O 
these O 
two O 
issues O 
is O 
also O 
related O 
to O 
the O 
stance O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Arab I-ORG 
League I-ORG 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
it O 
wo O 
n't O 
be O 
anything O 
new O 
. O 

And O 
we O 
've O 
heard O 
resolutions O 
and O 
political O 
stances O 
from O 
each O 
individual O 
state O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
which O 
uh O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
stress O 
the O 
unity O 
of O 
Iraq B-LOC 
as O 
a O 
country O 
and O 
also O 
support O 
legitimacy O 
in O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
. O 

But O 
I O 
would O 
also O 
like O 
to O 
add O 
that O 
the O 
Custodian O 
of O 
the B-LOC 
Two I-LOC 
Holy I-LOC 
Shrines I-LOC 
referred O 
today O 
to O 
an O 
important O 
point O 
when O 
he O 
indicated O 
that O 
there O 
is O 
a O 
flaw O 
in O 
the O 
constitution O 
of O 
the O 
Council O 
. O 

He O 
pointed O 
out O 
we O 
support O 
or O 
contribute O 
to O 
solving O 
these O 
issues O 
outside O 
the O 
Council B-ORG 
states O 
or O 
those O 
related O 
to O 
the O 
region O 
and O 
we O 
can O 
not O 
solve O 
our O 
problems O 
within O 
the O 
Council B-ORG 
. O 

He O 
demanded O 
that O 
when O 
there O 
is O 
a O 
unified O 
stance O 
and O 
a O 
unified O 
word O 
, O 
it O 
can O 
contribute O 
to O 
solving O 
the O 
pending O 
problems O 
in O 
the O 
region O 
, O 
which O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
have O 
reasons O 
and O 
implications O 
that O 
affect O 
the O 
Council B-ORG 
states O 
. O 

Okay O 
, O 
Doctor O 
Zuhair B-PER 
, O 
regarding O 
Oman B-LOC 
's O 
refusal O 
to O 
join O 
the B-ORG 
Monetary I-ORG 
Union I-ORG 
in O 
2010 O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
in O 
your O 
opinion O 
, O 
how O 
much O 
impact O 
will O 
that O 
have O 
? O 

I O 
mean O 
, O 
I O 
think O 
it O 
's O 
not O 
Oman B-LOC 
. O 

If O 
we O 
follow O 
this O 
path O 
, O 
it O 
would O 
be O 
difficult O 
to O 
activate O 
the O 
states O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Cooperation I-ORG 
Council I-ORG 
. O 

I O 
think O 
that O 
if O 
there O 
are O 
sincere O 
intentions O 
and O 
a O 
serious O 
desire O 
among O 
leaders O 
for O 
the O 
good O 
of O 
the O 
people O 
, O 
not O 
only O 
with O 
regard O 
to O 
economic O 
issues O 
or O 
even O 
the O 
military O 
issue O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
more O 
dangerous O 
, O 
when O 
we O 
feel O 
that O 
there O 
is O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
a O 
strong O 
Iranian O 
presence O 
in O 
the O 
region O 
, O 
and O 
if O 
this B-ORG 
Cooperation I-ORG 
Council I-ORG 
does O 
not O 
transform O 
into O 
a O 
regional O 
power O 
among O 
its O 
individuals O 
and O 
peoples O 
in O 
order O 
to O 
realize O 
their O 
interests O 
, O 
it O 
will O 
certainly O 
fail O 
in O 
the O 
long O 
run O 
. O 

We O 
now O 
meet O 
with O 
His O 
Highness O 
Dr. O

Mr. O 
Abdel B-PER 
- I-PER 
Hussein I-PER 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
today O 
, O 
after O 
the O 
bombing O 
that O 
occurred O 
at O 
Al B-LOC 
- I-LOC 
Tayaran I-LOC 
Square I-LOC 
leaving O 
dozens O 
of O 
innocent O 
civilians O 
victims O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Al B-PER 
- I-PER 
Maliki I-PER 
issued O 
a O 
statement O 
and O 
said O 
that O 
the O 
terrorists O 
and O 
the O 
Takfiris O 
and O 
their O 
Saddamist O 
allies O 
are O 
behind O 
this O 
crime O 
and O 
most O 
of O 
the O 
crimes O 
that O 
take O 
place O 
, O 
which O 
target O 
Iraqi O 
citizens O 
daily O 
in O 
the O 
capital O 
and O 
the O 
other O 
governorates O 
. O 

He O 
also O 
said O 
that O 
it O 
reveals O 
that O 
the O 
terrorist O 
groups O 
that O 
stand O 
behind O 
it O 
seek O 
to O 
spread O 
the O 
anarchy O 
of O 
killing O 
and O 
crime O 
and O 
to O 
drag O 
Iraq B-LOC 
into O 
the O 
crucible O 
of O 
war O 
and O 
sectarian O 
sedition O 
. O 

The O 
truth O 
is O 
, O 
when O 
the O 
objective O 
is O 
either O 
I O 
rule O 
over O 
you O 
or O 
I O 
kill O 
you O 
, O 
or O 
the O 
objective O 
is O 
either O 
I O 
take O 
hold O 
of O 
everything O 
I O 
can O 
without O 
consideration O 
of O 
national O 
interests O 
, O 
or O 
without O 
consideration O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
of O 
the O 
complexities O 
of O 
the O 
Iraqi O 
circumstances O 
, O 
then O 
, O 
in O 
reality O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
continuing O 
in O 
this O 
situation O 
wo O 
n't O 
change O 
anything O 
in O 
the O 
reality O 
of O 
situation O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
. O 

The O 
issue O 
is O 
, O 
either O 
there O 
is O 
a O 
sincere O 
patriotic O 
intention O 
to O 
transcend O 
this O 
situation O 
towards O 
a O 
better O 
situation O 
, O 
transcend O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
the O 
phase O 
of O 
dictatorship O 
that O 
Iraq B-LOC 
experienced O 
, O 
then O 
the O 
phase O 
of O 
the O 
mistakes O 
of O 
the O 
American O 
occupation O 
whose O 
price O 
the O 
Iraqi O 
people O 
are O 
paying O 
. O 

Yes O 
, O 
allow O 
me O 
to O 
go O 
back O 
to O 
Dr. O 
Saged B-PER 
Hamid I-PER 
. O 

Dr. O 
Saged B-PER 
ah O 
I O 
would O 
like O 
to O 
pause O 
with O 
the O 
bombing O 
that O 
happened O 
today O 
in O 
al B-LOC 
- I-LOC 
Tayaran I-LOC 
Square I-LOC 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
considered O 
the O 
fourth O 
to O 
target O 
this O 
square O 
in O 
mid-Baghdad B-LOC 
. O 

And O 
some O 
also O 
ask O 
about O 
those O 
who O 
support O 
these O 
groups O 
and O 
who O 
support O 
these O 
bombings O 
which O 
were O 
able O 
to O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
penetrate O 
all O 
the O 
security O 
barriers O 
that O 
surround O 
Baghdad B-LOC 
. O 

I O 
believe O 
the O 
goal O 
of O 
these O 
operations O 
is O 
to O 
paralyze O 
life O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
, O 
especially O 
in O 
Baghdad B-LOC 
, O 
the O 
capital O 
. O 

And O 
to O 
the O 
slip O 
of O 
the O 
tongue O 
that O 
was O 
made O 
by O 
Ehud B-PER 
Olmert I-PER 
, O 
in O 
which O 
he O 
admitted O 
that O 
the O 
Israeli O 
entity O 
has O 
nuclear O 
weapons O 
. O 

This O 
interview O 
was O 
in O 
Germany B-LOC 
with O 
German O 
television O 
. O 

But O 
stranger O 
than O 
that O 
was O 
the O 
reply O 
to O 
him O 
by O 
Mordechai B-PER 
Vanunu I-PER 
, O 
who O 
was O 
detained O 
for O 
several O 
years O 
after O 
he O 
revealed O 
the O 
secrets O 
of O 
the O 
nuclear O 
weapons O 
inside O 
the O 
Israeli O 
entity O 
. O 

Vanunu B-PER 
said O 
that O 
the O 
whole O 
world O 
knows O 
about O 
what O 
Ehud B-PER 
Olmert I-PER 
declared O 
. O 

And O 
in O 
any O 
case O 
, O 
specifically O 
Roni B-PER 
Shaked I-PER 
wrote O 
, O 
I O 
was O 
not O 
surprised O 
by O 
Olmert B-PER 
's O 
statements O 
. O 

The O 
entire O 
world O 
knows O 
that O 
Israel B-LOC 
has O 
nuclear O 
weapons O 
. O 

It O 
was O 
necessary O 
for O 
a O 
person O 
with O 
an O 
official O 
capacity O 
in O 
Israel B-LOC 
to O 
stand O 
up O 
and O 
say O 
that O 
, O 
and O 
Olmert B-PER 
said O 
that O 
yesterday O 
, O 

That O 
was O 
the O 
response O 
of O 
the O 
nuclear O 
spy O 
Mordechai B-PER 
Vanunu I-PER 
to O 
the O 
slip O 
of O 
the O 
tongue O 
by O 
Olmert B-PER 
. O 

Vanunu B-PER 
gave O 
an O 
interview O 
yesterday O 
with O 
the O 
Al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Ayyam I-ORG 
Palestinian O 
newspaper O 
that O 
is O 
published O 
in O 
Ramallah B-LOC 
. O 

The O 
former O 
spy O 
said O 
: O 
Years O 
ago O 
, O 
I O 
spoke O 
about O 
the O 
nuclear O 
weapons O 
that O 
Israel B-LOC 
possesses O 
, O 
after O 
I B-LOC 
had O 
spoken O 
, O 
Israel B-LOC 
was O 
obliged O 
to O 
admit O 
that O 
it O 
possessed O 
nuclear O 
weapons O 
. O 

I O 
hope O 
now O 
, O 
and O 
in O 
the O 
aftermath O 
of O 
the O 
statements O 
by O 
the O 
prime O 
minister O 
, O 
that O 
Israel B-LOC 
will O 
change O 
its O 
policy O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Ahmad B-PER 
Rafiq I-PER 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
Vanunu B-PER 
says O 
that O 
as O 
you O 
noticed O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
trying O 
to O 
make O 
it O 
look O 
as O 
though O 
Olmert B-PER 
broke O 
the O 
taboo O 
, O 
but O 
Vanunu B-PER 
says O 
that O 
this O 
is O 
incorrect O 
, O 
that O 
the O 
whole O 
world O 
knows O 
that O 
the O 
Israeli O 
entity O 
possess O 
nuclear O 
weapons O 
. O 

Following O

of O 
the B-ORG

led O 
by O 
US O 
President O 
George B-PER

in O 
the O

up O 
by O 
the O 
group O 
composed O 
of O 
five O

will O 
serve O

for O 
US O 
President O 
George B-PER 
Bush I-PER 
to O 
reconsider O 
his O

Alam I-PER

that O 
Lebanese O

Siniora I-PER 
demanded O 
from O 
Hezbollah B-LOC 
to O 
hand O 
over O 
its O

and O 
that O 
was O 
at O 
the O

the O 
last O 
Israeli O 
aggression O

the O

And O 
there O 
he O 
was O 
, O 
Prime O

, O 
proposing O 
in O

of O 
everyone O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
that O 
if O 
we O 
want O 
to O 
get O 
out O 
of O 
this O 
war O 
, O 
so O 
Haj B-PER 
, O 
you O 
only O 
have O 
to O 
obey O 
that O 
Hezbollah B-LOC 
should O 
hand O 
over O 
its O 
weapons O 
. O 

He O 
said O 
other O 
than O 
that O 
option O 
, O 
the O 
Cabinet B-ORG 
, O 
if O 
you O 
do O 
not O 
want O 
to O 
hand O 
them O 
over O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
voluntarily O 
, O 
then O 
the O 
Cabinet B-ORG 
will O 
convene O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
Council I-ORG 
of I-ORG 
Ministers I-ORG 
, O 
and O 
demand O 
ah O 
and O 
we O 
give O 
authorization O 
to O 
the O 
Lebanese O 
army O 
to O 
perform O 
break O

ins O 
and O 
it O 
would O 
confiscate O 
the O 
weapons O 
without O 
you O 
having O 
to O 
hand O 
them O 
over O 
, O 
I O

by O

I O

that O

confronting O

telling O 
him O

Aharon B-PER 
Barak I-PER 
in O 
the B-LOC 
Supreme I-LOC

yesterday O 
that O 
the O

this O

Now O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
Barak B-PER 
as O 
they O 
say O

and O 
admits O 
that O 
killing O

gives O 
it O

Mr. O

welcome O

Ah O 
, O 
I O 
do O 
not O 
believe O 
that O 
all O 
of O 
what O 
is O 
happening O 
in O 
the O 
Arab O 
world O 
and O 
the O 
Islamic O 
world O 
, O 
even O 
if O 
it O 
is O 
normal O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
normal O 
for O 
the O 
West B-LOC 
, O 
especially O 
the O 
Zionist O 
fronts O 
that O 
are O 
waiting O 
to O 
provoke O 
whatever O 
issue O 
and O 
exploit O 
it O 
against O 
the O 
Arabs O 
and O 
against O 
Muslims O 
in O 
general O 
. O 

As O 
I O 
take O 
the O 
other O 
side O 
of O 
this O 
issue O 
and O 
its O 
reactions O 
, O 
as O 
I O 
mentioned O 
, O 
to O 
the O 
world O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
normal O 
that O 
it O 
caused O 
a O 
turmoil O 
and O 
a O 
turmoil O 
especially O 
in O 
Bulgaria B-LOC 
and O 
the O 
countries O 
of O 
the O 
world O 
in O 
particular O 
, O 
until O 
the O 
US O 
Secretary O 
of O

, O 
Condoleezza B-PER 
Rice I-PER 
, O 
tackled O 
the O 
issue O 
. O 

Okay O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Demis B-PER 
from O 
Portland B-LOC 
, O 
do O 
you O 
share O 
Mr. O 
Vegan B-PER 
Zino I-PER 
's O 
opinion O 
? O 

How O 
can O 
the O 
new O 
Security B-ORG 
Council I-ORG 
resolutions O 
change O 
, O 
especially O 
with O 
relation O 
to O 
the O 
Middle B-LOC 
East I-LOC 
issues O 
, O 
and O 
he O 
mentioned O 
North B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
in O 
particular O 
and O 
Bolton B-PER 
's O 
push O 
towards O 
imposing O 
sanctions O 
on O 
it O 
and O 
the O 
efforts O 
he O 
made O 
for O 
that O 
purpose O 
? O 

Will O 
this O 
perhaps O 
positively O 
be O 
reflected O 
now O 
that O 
Bolton B-PER 
has O 
left O 
with O 
his O 
hard O 
line O 
policy O 
and O 
even O 
his O 
way O 
of O 
talking O 
about O 
various O 
issues O 
? O 

I O 
think O 
that O 
most O 
of O 
Bolton B-PER 
's O 
efforts O 
were O 
aimed O 
at O 
the O 
hawkish O 
view O 
towards O 
Iran B-LOC 
. O 

From O 
the O 
start O 
, O 
they O 
exerted O 
pressure O 
in O 
order O 
to O 
impose O 
sanctions O 
and O 
a O 
strict O 
policy O 
, O 
stricter O 
than O 
the O 
policies O 
of O 
other O 
Security B-ORG 
Council I-ORG 
member O 
states O 
, O 
and O 
this O 
is O 
why O 
Security B-ORG 
Council I-ORG 
member O 
states O 
and O 
other O 
states O 
did O 
n't O 
agree O 
with O 
these O 
policies O 
, O 
and O 
this O 
led O 
to O 
division O 
. O 

Of O 
course O 
the O 
other O 
parties O 
did O 
n't O 
exert O 
this O 
kind O 
of O 
pressure O 
and O 
did O 
n't O 
want O 
this O 
policy O 
against O 
Iran B-LOC 
. O 

Bolton B-PER 
did O 
n't O 
hesitate O 
to O 
follow O 
this O 
strict O 
policy O 
against O 
Iran B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
he O 
was O 
n't O 
able O 
to O 
convince O 
the O 
other O 
states O 
to O 
follow O 
this O 
same O 
policy O 
. O 

Then O 
, O 
I O 
predict O 
that O 
the O 
person O 
who O 
will O 
replace O 
Bolton B-PER 
wo O 
n't O 
be O 
from O 
the O 
military O 
or O 
from O 
the O 
hard O

, O 
especially O 
with O 
regard O 
to O 
the O 
Iranian O 
nuclear O 
issue O

are O 
the O

As O 
for O 
background O 
of O 
this O

this O

despite O

some O

Uh O 
, O 
the O 
latest O 
information O 
that O 
we O 
received O 
so O 
far O 
is O 
that O 
these O 
battles O 
between O 
the O 
two O 
sides O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
started O 
after O 
the O 
Friday O 
prayers O 
and O 
they O 
started O 
exactly O 
in O 
a O 
place O 
known O 
, O 
a O 
small O 
village O 
called O 
Safar B-LOC 
Nooley I-LOC 
, O 
said O 
to O 
be O 
80 O 
kilometers O

in O 
the O 
direction O 
of O

Uh O 
, O 
however O 
, O 
the O 
news O 
from O 
the O 
transitional O 
government O 
says O 
that O 
the O 
battles O 
were O 
actually O 
in O 
places O 
close O 
to O 
the O 
city O 
of O 
Dinsor B-LOC

And O 
the O 
battles O 
were O 
very O 
fierce O 
and O 
lasted O 
more O 
than O 
two O 
hours O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
we O 
had O 
tried O 
to O 
communicate O 
with O 
the O 
cities O 
close O 
to O 
it O 
, O 
but O 
because O 
communications O 
from O 
that O 
city O 
were O 
cut O 
off O 
for O 
more O 
than O 
a O 
week O 
, O 
it O 
hindered O 
uh O 
, O 
that O 
we O 
find O 
detailed O 
news O 
or O 
eyewitnesses O 
in O 
that B-LOC 
city I-LOC 
. O 

Uh O 
, O 
but O 
a O 
short O 
while O 
ago O 
, O 
and O 
according O 
to O 
a O 
communication O 
with O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
officials O 
in O 
the B-ORG 
Islamic I-ORG 
Courts I-ORG 
, O 
Mr. O 
Mukhtar B-PER 
Abu I-PER 
Mansour I-PER 
, O 
who O 
is O 
the O 
representative O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Security I-ORG 
Office I-ORG 
of I-ORG 
the I-ORG 
Islamic I-ORG 
Courts I-ORG 
, O 
he O 
says O 
that O 
the O 
battle O 
is O 
over O 
and O 
that O 
they O 
were O 
able O 
to O 
control O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
that B-LOC 
village I-LOC 
. O 

Uh O 
, O 
and O 
we O 
asked O 
him O 
, O 
is O 
it O 
the O 
city O 
of O 
Dinsor B-LOC 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
is O 
any O 
of O 
the O 
city O 
of O 
Dinsor B-LOC 
in O 
their O 
hands O 
? O 

He O 
added O 
that O 
this B-LOC 
city I-LOC 
is O 
still O 
in O 
their O 
hands O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
but O 
the O 
transitional O 
government O 
side O 
is O 
still O 
insisting O 
that O 
the O 
battle O 
is O 
ongoing O 
at O 
this O 
moment O 
and O 
that O 
it O 
is O 
on O 
the O 
outskirts O 
of O 
the O 
town O 
of O 
Dinsor B-LOC 
. O 

Fahd B-PER 
, O 
a O 
few O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
days O 
ago O 
also O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
the O 
situation O 
was O 
still O 
the O 
same O 
and O 
communications O 
were O 
cut O 
off O 
as O 
they O 
still O 
are O 
in O 
Dinsor B-LOC 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
but O 
at O 
the O 
time O 
, O 
the O 
government O 
said O 
that O 
it O 
had O 
regained O 
control O 
over O 
it O 
, O 
and O 
as O 
a O 
result O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
this O 
dispute O 
could O 
still O 
be O 
going O 
on O 
till O 
now O 
, O 
each O 
side O 
saying O 
that O 
it O 
has O 
controlled O 
it O 
, O 
right O 
? O 

This O 
is O 
true O 
, O 
because O 
the O 
problem O 
in O 
this B-LOC 
city I-LOC 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
even O 
the O 
situation O 
in O 
Somalia B-LOC 
, O 
if O 
such O 
a O 
war O 
had O 
occurred O 
, O 
the O 
news O 
would O 
have O 
reached O 
us O 
as O 
fast O 
as O 
possible O 
, O 
but O 
because O 
communications O 
are O 
cut O 
off O 
from O 
that B-LOC 
city I-LOC 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
the O 
news O 
remains O 
, O 
because O 
it O 
is O 
a O 
marginal O 
city O 
given O 
the O 
location O 
of O 
the B-LOC 
city I-LOC 
. O 

And O 
so O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
days O 
ago O 
, O 
as O 
you O 
and O 
I O 
said O 
, O 
the O 
government O 
was O 
saying O 
it O 
had O 
recaptured O 
, O 
but O 
today O 
uh O 
the O 
situation O 
happened O 
again O 
and O 
the B-ORG 
Islamic I-ORG 
Courts I-ORG 
and O 
the O 
forces O 
of O 
the O 
transitional O

are O 
still O

the O

the O

but O 
the B-ORG 
Islamic I-ORG 
Courts I-ORG 
, O 
as O 
I O 
told O 
you O 
, O 
the O 
battle O 
is O 
outside O 
the O 
city O 
of O 
Dinsor B-LOC 
at O 
a O 
distance O 
of O 
40 O 
kilometers O

Fahd B-PER 
Yassin I-PER

Al B-ORG

correspondent O 
, O 
from O 
Mogadishu B-LOC 
, O 
thank O 
you O 
very O 
much O 
. O 

Joining O 
us O 
from O 
Gaza B-LOC 
is O 
Nemer O 
Hammad B-PER 
, O 
the O 
Palestinian O 
President O 
's O 
Political O 
Affairs O 
Advisor O 
. O 

And O 
Erekat B-PER 
today O 
confirms O 
that O 
the O 
current O 
government O 
may O 
be O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
options O 
proposed O 
to O 
President O 
Abbas B-PER 
. O 

So O 
the O 
brothers O 
in O 
Hamas B-ORG 
put O 
forth O 
the O 
issue O 
that O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
the O 
essential O 
portfolios O 
must O 
not O 
be O 
in O 
the O 
hands O 
of O 
independents O 
, O 
and O 
that O 
this O 
would O 
be O 
an O 
insult O 
to O 
the O 
leaders O 
of O 
the O 
factions O 
. O 

Historically O 
, O 
as O 
an O 
example O 
, O 
the O 
first O 
Finance O 
Minister O 
in O 
the O 
Authority B-ORG 
was O 
brother O 
Muhammad B-PER 
Zuhdi I-PER 
Al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Nashashibi I-PER 
, O 
and O 
he O 
is O 
an O 
independent O 
. O 

The O 
first O 
Palestinian O 
Interior O 
Minister O 
to O 
be O 
appointed O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
was O 
Major O 
General O 
Abdel B-PER 
- I-PER 
Razzaq I-PER 
Al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Yahya I-PER 
, O 
and O 
he O 
is O 
an O 
independent O 
. O 

Yet O 
another O 
problem O 
surfaced O 
and O 
it O 
was O 
a O 
surprise O 
, O 
and O 
now O 
it O 
is O 
being O 
repeated O 
in O 
the O 
statements O 
of O 
some O 
of O 
the O 
brothers O 
in O 
the O 
Hamas B-ORG 
leadership O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
appointment O 
letter O 
by O 
the O 
president O 
and O 
the O 
National O 
Reconciliation O 
document O 
I O 
mean O 
are O 
not O 
sufficient O 
in O 
order O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
for O 
the O 
government O 
to O 
obtain O 
the O 
vote O 
of O 
confidence O 
. O 

The O 
government O 
receives O 
encouragement O 
from O 
the B-ORG 
Legislative I-ORG 
Council I-ORG 
, O 
thus O 
it O 
becomes O 
effective O 
as O 
if O 
the O 
appointment O 
letter O 
and O 
the O 
National O 
Reconciliation O 
document O 
or O 
the O 
prisoners O 
are O 
worthless O 
. O 

Okay O 
, O 
speaking O 
about O 
this O 
economic O 
and O 
financial O 
siege O 
, O 
today O 
Abbas B-PER 
said O 
that O 
we O 
want O 
a O 
government O 
capable O 
of O 
lifting O 
the O 
siege O 
now O 
with O 
these O 
efforts O 
that O 
have O 
resulted O 
so O 
far O 
in O 
a O 
kind O 
of O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
untangling O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
of O 
some O 
of O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
these O 
difficulties O 
that O 
have O 
befallen O 
or O 
or O 
are O 
facing O 
the O 
Palestinian O 
people O 
. O 

There O 
is O 
a O 
Qatari O 
initiative O 
to O 
pay O 
the O 
salaries O 
of O 
some O 
employees O 
in O 
uh O

Mr. O

, O 
normally O 
uh O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
a O 
prime O

does O

uh O

uh O

Could O 
it O

said O 
that O 
uh O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Al B-PER

Maliki I-PER

a O

I O 
do O 
n't O 
think O 
that O 
there O 
is O

uh O 
, O 
I O

a O

Al B-PER

, O 
is O

say O 
that O 
he O 
is O 
doing O 
something O

In O 
fact O 
, O 
the O 
major O 
problem O 
, O 
whether O 
for O 
the O 
Americans O

for O

the O 
American O

Mr. O

I O 
mean O 
, O 
from O 
our O

uh O 
, O 
this O

we O

that O

Le B-ORG

Match I-ORG

sort O 
of O 
focused O 
on O 
a O 
single O 
issue O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
with O 
respect O 
to O 
the O 
assassination O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
of O 
the O 
young O 
minister O 
and O 
MP O 
Pierre B-PER 
Gemayel I-PER 
. O 

Uh O 
, O 
how O 
do O 
you O 
see O 
the O 
points O 
of O 
similarity O 
that O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
were O 
made O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
by O 
Le B-ORG 
Point I-ORG 
between O 
the O 
Kennedy B-PER 
family O 
and O 
Gemayel B-PER 
family O 
? O 

There O 
is O 
an O 
error O 
reported O 
by O 
Le B-ORG 
Point I-ORG 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
not O 
a O 
minor O 
one O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
that O 
Pierre B-PER 
Gemayel I-PER 
the O 
grandfather O 
was O 
assassinated O 
. O 

but O 
there O 
are O 
some O 
members O 
of O 
the O 
Gemayel B-PER 
family O 
and O 
their O 
in-laws O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
the O 
Aswad B-PER 
family O 
, O 
were O 
assassinated O 
under O 
circumstances O 
we O 
all O 
know O 
. O 

Nevertheless O 
, O 
the O 
sad O 
thing O 
in O 
this O 
matter O 
is O 
that O 
not O 
only O 
the O 
Gemayel B-PER 
family O 
has O 
this O 
similarity O 
with O 
the O 
Kennedys B-PER 
; O 
there O 
are O 
many O 
families O 
in O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
that O 
have O 
lost O 
the O 
father O 
and O 
the O 
grandfather O 
and O 
sometimes O 
the O 
grandson O 
, O 
including O 
the O 
Jumblatts B-PER 
, O 
including O 
the O 
Chamouns B-PER 
and O 
others O 
. O 

The O 
reality O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
Sykes B-PER 
- O 
Picot B-PER 
case O 
, O 
at O 
that O 
time O 
, O 
when O 
it O 
was O 
set O 
, O 
only O 
paid O 
attention O 
to O 
the O 
interests O 
of O 
the O 
countries O 
and O 
the O 
outcome O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
the O 
balance O 
of O 
power O 
among O 
them O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
between O 
France B-LOC 
in O 
the O 
first O 
place O 
and O 
Britain B-LOC 
or O 
the B-LOC 
United I-LOC 
Kingdom I-LOC 
. O 

So O 
we O 
see O 
that O 
what O 
is O 
happening O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
, O 
in O 
reality O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
under O 
the O 
sights O 
of O 
the B-LOC 
United I-LOC 
States I-LOC 
, O 
which O 
is O 
-- O 
occupying O 
Iraq B-LOC 
; O 
we O 
see O 
that O 
Iraq B-LOC 
might O 
actually O 
be O 
divided O 
into O 
three O 
districts O 
, O 
ah O 
these O 
areas O 
agree O 
to O 
a O 
great O 
extent O 
with O 
the O 
idea O 
of O 
sectarianism O 
and O 
factionism O 
existing O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
. O 

Ah O 
, O 
no O 
, O 
I O 
want O 
to O 
say O 
that O 
this O 
tendency O 
, O 
there O 
are O 
efforts O 
to O 
expand O 
it O 
and O 
generalize O 
it O 
in O 
the O 
region O 
, O 
or O 
what O 
is O 
sometimes O 
called O 
Balkanizing O 
the O 
region O 
like O 
what O 
happened O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
after O 
the O 
collapse O 
of O 
the B-LOC 
Soviet I-LOC 
Union I-LOC 
and O 
the O 
collapse O 
of O 
socialism O 
in O 
some O 
countries O 
of O 
Western B-LOC 
Europe I-LOC 
. O 

This O 
is O 
clear O 
, O 
thank O 
you O 
so O 
much O 
, O 
Dr. O 
Jawad B-PER 
Al I-PER 
Anani I-PER 
, O 
and O 
sorry O 
about O 
the O 
tight O 
time O 
. O 

Our O 
esteemed O 
viewers O 
from O 
Amman B-LOC 
participated O 
with O 
us O 
. O 

We O 
return O 
again O 
, O 
our O 
viewers O 
, O 
to O 
our O 
guest O 
on O 
today O 
's O 
episode O 
, O 
Dr. O 
Khattar B-PER 
Abu I-PER 
Diab I-PER 
. O 

Uh O 
, O 
Dr. O 
Khattar B-PER 
, O 
the B-ORG 
New I-ORG 
York I-ORG 
Times I-ORG 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
cites O 
a O 
neutral O 
poll O 
that O 
indicates O 
that O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
the O 
popularity O 
of O 
Abbas B-PER 
is O 
ahead O 
of O 
the O 
popularity O 
of O 
Haniyeh B-PER 
by O 
at O 
least O 
six O 
points O 
. O 

Uh O 
, O 
in O 
your O 
opinion O 
, O 
does O 
this O 
justify O 
the O 
rejection O 
by O 
Hamas B-ORG 
of O 
Abbas B-PER 
's O 
call O 
for O 
early O 
elections O 
? O 

I O 
do O 
n't O 
think O 
that O 
Hamas B-ORG 
's O 
rejection O 
is O 
linked O 
to O 
the O 
results O 
of O 
this O 
poll O 
or O 
to O 
its O 
fear O 
of O 
its O 
declining O 
popularity O 
. O 

There O 
is O 
an O 
impasse O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
the O 
impasse O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Palestinian I-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Authority I-ORG 
in O 
itself O 
. O 

This O 
Authority B-ORG 
was O 
built O 
on O 
the O 
basis O 
of O 
agreements O 
that O 
have O 
not O 
been O 
implemented O 
. O 

And O 
the O 
advent O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Hamas I-ORG 
Movement I-ORG 
came O 
to O 
add O 
complexity O 
to O 
things O 
because O 
effectively O 
, O 
it O 
did O 
not O 
recognize O 
the O 
framework O 
through O 
which O 
it O 
came O 
to O 
power O 
. O 

Also O 
adding O 
complexity O 
to O 
things O 
is O 
the O 
American B-LOC 
and O 
British B-LOC 
rejection O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Hamas I-ORG 
Movement I-ORG 
, O 
i.e. O 
there O 
was O 
a O 
contradiction O 
in O 
supporting O 
, O 
for O 
example O 
, O 
the O 
Siniora B-ORG 
government O 
in O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
and O 
not O 
recognizing O 
a O 
democratically O 
elected O 
government O 
in O 
Palestine B-LOC 
as O 
well O 
. O 

And O 
among O 
the O 
repercussions O 
in O 
the O 
matter O 
is O 
the O 
lack O 
of O 
clarity O 
concerning O 
a O 
successor O 
to O 
Arafat B-PER 
and O 
the O 
lack O 
of O 
clarity O 
of O 
the O 
position O 
within O 
the B-ORG 
Fatah I-ORG 
Movement I-ORG 
itself O 
. O 

During O 
the O 
days O 
of O 
Arafat B-PER 
, O 
this O 
reshuffling O 
was O 
long O 
delayed O 
, O 
and O 
now O 
it O 
is O 
happening O 
, O 
but O 
not O 
for O 
the O 
benefit O 
of O 
the O 
Palestinian O 
people O 
. O 

Because O 
when O 
this O 
people O 
is O 
headed O 
towards O 
a O 
civil O 
war O 
, O 
neither O 
Hamas B-ORG 
leadership O 
nor O 
Fatah B-ORG 
leadership O 
is O 
of O 
use O 
any O 
longer O 
; O 
rather O 
the O 
gains O 
that O 
were O 
achieved O 
in O 
the O 
recent O 
period O 
may O 
be O 
threatened O 
as O 
a O 
whole O 
. O 

A O 
representative O 
in O 
the B-ORG 
Iraqi I-ORG 
Parliament I-ORG 
and O 
a O 
leader O 
in O 
the O 
al B-PER 
- I-PER 
Sadr I-PER 
current O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Salam B-PER 
. O 

First O 
ah O 
as O 
we O 
know O 
that O 
Al B-PER 
- I-PER 
Sadr I-PER 
current O 
had O 
announced O 
the O 
suspension O 
of O 
its O 
participation O 
in O 
the O 
government O 
and O 
the O 
parliament O 
in O 
opposition O 
to O 
the O 
meeting O 
of O 
Bush B-PER 
and O 
Al B-PER 
Maliki I-PER 
, O 
the O 
Iraqi O 
Prime O 
Minister O 
. O 

This O 
is O 
not O 
the O 
first O 
time O 
an O 
Iraqi O 
Prime O 
Minister O 
has O 
met O 
with O 
President O 
Bush B-PER 
, O 
right O 
? O 

believes O 
that O 
all O 
these O 
acts O 
of O 
violence O 
or O 
what O 
is O 
going O 
on O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
and O 
the O 
deterioration O 
of O 
the O 
situation O 
, O 
that O 
the O 
reason O 
for O 
that O 
is O 
the O 
occupation O 
forces O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
when O 
the O 
Al B-PER 
- I-PER 
Sadr I-PER 
current O 
opposed O 
ah O 
ah O 
the O 
meeting O 
of O 
Mr. O 
Al B-PER 
- I-PER 
Maliki I-PER 
with O 
Bush B-PER 
, O 
considering O 
the O 
Americans O 
are O 
responsible O 
, O 
a O 
direct O 
responsibility O 
, O 
for O 
what O 
is O 
happening O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
. O 

Once O 
again O 
, O 
did O 
this O 
responsibility O 
come O 
up O 
now O 
, O 
as O 
you O 
say O 
the O 
responsibility O 
of O 
the O 
Americans O 
for O 
what O 
is O 
happening O 
, O 
or O 
was O 
it O 
the O 
reason O 
in O 
the O 
past O 
, O 
for O 
example O 
, O 
Al B-PER 
- I-PER 
Ja'fari I-PER 
's I-PER 
government O 
Prime O 
Minister O 
Al B-PER 
- I-PER 
Ja'fari I-PER 
, O 
to O 
be O 
in O 
this O 
government O 
, O 
he O 
met O 
with O 
Bush B-PER 
, O 
it O 
did O 
not O 
cause O 
any O 
fuss O 
? O 

Certainly O 
, O 
certainly O 
, O 
but O 
now O 
things O 
started O 
to O 
get O 
more O 
dangerous O 
and O 
to O 
get O 
more O 
heated O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
security O 
situations O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
started O 
to O 
deteriorate O 
bit O 
by O 
bit O 
, O 
so O 
actually O 
we O 
have O 
reached O 
a O 
stage O 
the O 
street O 
would O 
not O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
handle O 
what O 
is O 
going O 
on O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
we O 
said O 
that O 
there O 
should O 
be O 
an O 
earnest O 
and O 
effective O 
step O 
from O 
the O 
government O 
to O 
receive O 
the O 
security O 
dossier O 
, O 
because O 
the O 
situation O 
of O 
the O 
dead O 
and O 
the O 
situation O 
of O 
what O 
is O 
happening O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
has O 
become O 
a O 
terrifying O 
and O 
very O 
frightening O 
situation O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Salam B-PER 
, O 
personally O 
, O 
do O 
you O 
consider O 
this O 
step O 
successful O 
? O 

Definitely O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
ah O 
a O 
political O 
justification O 
, O 
or O 
a O 
political O 
position O 
that O 
the O 
Al B-PER 
- I-PER 
Sadr I-PER 
current O 
adopted O 
, O 
I O 
hope O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
that O 
there O 
would O 
be O 
a O 
round O 
of O 
dialogue O 
between O 
ah O 
the O 
political O 
powers O 
and O 
the O 
government O 
in O 
order O 
to O 
coordinate O 
the O 
position O 
before O 
announcing O 
it O 
. O 

Ah O 
we O 
hope O 
the O 
government O 
has O 
a O 
strong O 
position O 
and O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
a O 
strong O 
will O 
in O 
stabilizing O 
the O 
security O 
dossier O 
, O 
and O 
through O 
dialogue O 
with O 
the O 
Americans O 
; O 
so O 
the O 
position O 
of O 
the O 
Al B-PER 
- I-PER 
Sadr I-PER 
current O 
, O 
is O 
a O 
political O 
position O 
. O 

Ok O 
, O 
Bush B-PER 
did O 
not O 
only O 
meet O 
with O 
the O 
Prime O 
Minister O 
, O 
but O 
he O 
also O 
met O 
with O 
Abd B-PER 
al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Aziz I-PER 
al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Hakim I-PER 
, O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
senior O 
Shiite O 
leaders O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
, O 
as O 
you O 
know O 
. O 

Are O 
you O 
going O 
to O 
apply O 
the O 
same O 
thing O 
you O 
did O 
with O 
the O 
Prime O 
Minister O 
to O 
Bush B-PER 
's O 
meeting O 
with O 
Abd B-PER 
- I-PER 
al I-PER 
Aziz I-PER 
al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Hakim I-PER 
? O 

No O 
, O 
naturally O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
Supreme I-ORG 
Council I-ORG 
has O 
its O 
own O 
policy O 
, O 
and O 
I O 
believe O 
it O 
is O 
a O 
party O 
that O 
has O 
its O 
political O 
plan O 
. O 

As O 
for O 
the O 
government O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
responsible O 
for O 
the O 
security O 
of O 
Iraq B-LOC 
as O 
a O 
whole O 
; O 
so O 
when O 
the O 
Al B-PER 
- I-PER 
Sadr I-PER 
current O 
announced O 
its O 
position O 
, O 
it O 
was O 
asking O 
the O 
government O 
to O 
have O 
the O 
power O 
in O 
controlling O 
the O 
security O 
situation O 
, O 
and O 
it O 
has O 
the O 
bigger O 
role O 
in O 
receiving O 
the O 
security O 
dossier O 
. O 

You O 
are O 
belittling O 
in O 
this O 
case O 
the O 
influence O 
of O 
Abd B-PER 
al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Aziz I-PER 
al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Hakim I-PER 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
you O 
say O 
he O 
has O 
no O 
importance O 
compared O 
to O 
the O 
Prime O 
Minister O 
, O 
right O 
? O 

No O 
, O 
certainly O 
Abd B-PER 
al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Aziz I-PER 
al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Hakim I-PER 
is O 
a O 
political O 
man O 
, O 
who O 
has O 
his O 
political O 
project O 
, O 
but O 
we O 
are O 
demanding O 
the O 
Prime O 
Minister O 
, O 
he O 
has O 
the O 
bigger O 
authority O 
in O 
the O 
administration O 
of O 
Iraq B-LOC 
as O 
a O 
whole O 
, O 
but O 
Mr. O 
Abd B-PER 
al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Aziz I-PER 
al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Hakim I-PER 
is O 
a O 
contributing O 
party O 
in O 
the O 
political O 
process O 
, O 
and O 
he O 
has O 
his O 
political O 
role O 
. O 

Abd B-PER 
al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Aziz I-PER 
al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Hakim I-PER 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
you O 
want O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
has O 
his O 
political O 
program O 
; O 
his O 
political O 
program O 
is O 
different O 
from O 
your O 
program O 
? O 

Definitely O 
, O 
we O 
disagree O 
with O 
the O 
brothers O 
in O 
the B-ORG 
Supreme I-ORG 
Council I-ORG 
with O 
our O 
political O 
project O 
, O 
we O 
have O 
a O 
project O 
of O 
resistance O 
, O 
reform O 
and O 
change O 
. O 

How O 
accurate O 
is O 
the O 
revelation O 
of O 
armed O 
groups O 
leaders O 
or O 
gunmen O 
who O 
direct O 
armed O 
activity O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
from O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
? O 

It O 
may O 
have O 
helped O 
Iraq B-LOC 
and O 
helped O 
the O 
Iraqi O 
security O 
services O 
in O 
capturing O 
some O 
of O 
them O 
or O 
exposing O 
some O 
terrorist O 
organizations O 
. O 

Tell O 
me O 
your O 
opinion O 
on O 
the O 
Baker B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Hamilton I-ORG 
committee I-ORG 
recommendations O 
? O 

And O 
I O 
know O 
that O 
much O 
of O 
its O 
content O 
does O 
not O 
represent O 
the O 
will O 
and O 
direction O 
followed O 
by O 
the O 
Administration B-ORG 
. O 

Perhaps O 
the O 
reality O 
that O 
Iraq B-LOC 
and O 
the O 
region O 
are O 
going O 
through O 
may O 
impose O 
itself O 
through O 
the O 
difficulties O 
encountered O 
by O 
those O 
who O 
think O 
they O 
are O 
providing O 
the O 
solution O 
. O 

But O 
if O 
I O 
were O 
asked O 
to O 
briefly O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
evaluate O 
the O 
report O 
, O 
I O 
would O 
say O 
that O 
it O 
is O 
not O 
lacking O 
in O 
good O 
indications O 
related O 
to O 
the O 
political O 
course O 
and O 
the O 
unity O 
of O 
Iraq B-LOC 
. O 

Mr. O 
Azzam B-PER 
, O 
to O 
begin O 
with O 
, O 
could O 
you O 
guide O 
us O 
, O 
if O 
possible O 
, O 
to O 
a O 
clear O 
and O 
numbered O 
provision O 
in O 
the O 
constitution O 
that O 
allows O 
President O 
Abbas B-PER 
to O 
call O 
for O 
these O 
early O 
elections O 
? O 

Okay O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Azzam B-PER 
, O 
do O 
you O 
agree O 
that O 
the O 
step O 
that O 
President O 
Abbas B-PER 
has O 
taken O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
in O 
fact O 
represents O 
a O 
violation O 
of O 
the O 
principle O 
of O 
the O 
separation O 
of O 
powers O 
. O 

And O 
our O 
guest O 
, O 
Azam B-PER 
al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Ahmed I-PER 
, O 
Chairman O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Fatah I-ORG 
Movement I-ORG 
Parliament I-ORG 
Bloc I-ORG 
. O 

Mr. O 
Azam B-PER 
Al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Ahmed I-PER 
, O 
at O 
a O 
time O 
when O 
the O 
international O 
community O 
is O 
actually O 
demanding O 
Hamas B-ORG 
to O 
recognize O 
Israel B-LOC 
and O 
reject O 
violence O 
, O 
we O 
hear O 
some O 
of O 
your O 
colleagues O 
actually O 
criticizing O 
Hamas B-ORG 
, O 
that O 
its O 
members O 
have O 
not O 
fired O 
one O 
shot O 
at O 
the O 
Israelis O 
since O 
the O 
truce O 
agreement O 
. O 

We O 
say O 
yes O 
, O 
Hamas B-ORG 
was O 
the O 
regiment O 
most O 
committed O 
to O 
the O 
truce O 
that O 
was O 
announced O 
in O 
Cairo B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
this O 
is O 
not O 
at O 
all O 
a O 
fault O 
, O 
but O 
rather O 
we O 
rather O 
respect O 
this O 
position O 
. O 

Ok O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Azam B-PER 
al I-PER 
- I-PER 
Ahmed I-PER 
, O 
from O 
another O 
perspective O 
, O 
ah O 
as O 
you O 
know O 
Fatah B-ORG 
formed O 
all O 
, O 
if O 
not O 
most O 
, O 
of O 
the O 
Palestinian O 
governments O 
that O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
have O 
existed O 
since O 
the O 
Oslo O 
Agreement O 
; O 
Fatah B-ORG 
also O 
complied O 
with O 
international O 
standards O 
, O 
as O 
foreign O 
officials O 
say O 
. O 

I O 
mean O 
, O 
we O 
signed O 
an O 
agreement O 
as O 
a B-ORG 
Palestinian I-ORG 
Liberation I-ORG 
Organization I-ORG 
and O 
ah O 
the O 
governments O 
committed O 
by O 
the O 
successive O 
, O 
and O 
by O 
the O 
way O 
ah O 
we O 
were O 
continuously O 
, O 
Fatah B-ORG 
, O 
inviting O 
everyone O 
to O 
participate O 
. O 

Those O 
who O 
accepted O 
participation O 
, O 
like O 
the B-ORG 
Al I-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Shaab I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
, O 
Feda B-ORG 
, O 
Popular B-ORG 
Resistance I-ORG 
Front I-ORG 
, O 
some O 
of O 
the O 
independents O 
and O 
the B-ORG 
Islamic I-ORG 
Current I-ORG 
, O 
were O 
always O 
members O 
of O 
the O 
government O 
. O 

Israel B-LOC 
ah O 
was O 
setting O 
up O 
barriers O 
. O 

We O 
succeeded O 
first O 
in O 
establishing O 
organizations O 
, O 
the O 
nucleus O 
of O 
the O 
Palestinian O 
entity O 
on O 
the O 
land O 
of O 
Palestine B-LOC 
, O 
on O 
the O 
way O 
to O 
establishing O 
the O 
independent O 
Palestinian O 
state O 
. O 

And O 
when O 
Israel B-LOC 
started O 
to O 
disclaim O 
the O 
agreements O 
, O 
we O 
clashed O 
with O 
it O 
and O 
Sharon B-PER 
, O 
who O 
actually O 
opposed O 
and O 
is O 
still O 
opposing O 
and O 
his O 
party O 
still O 
opposes O 
the O 
Oslo O 
Agreement O 
, O 
won O 
in O 
the O 
Knesset B-ORG 
elections O 
. O 

And O 
we O 
entered O 
a O 
struggle O 
since O 
the O 
year O 
2000 O 
till O 
now O 
, O 
and O 
before O 
that O 
the O 
Al O 
- O 
Nafaq O 
uprising O 
also O 
, O 
let O 
us O 
remember O 
it O 
well O 
; O 
this O 
is O 
why O 
Yasser B-PER 
Arafat I-PER 
was O 
put O 
under O 
siege O 
and O 
there O 
was O 
the O 
Al O 
- O 
Aqsa O 
Intifadah O 
and O 
there O 
was O 
a O 
re-invasion O 
, O 
because O 
the O 
struggle O 
was O 
renewed O 
, O 
because O 
we O 
refused O 
ah O 
to O 
accept O 
the O 
Israeli O 
dictates O 
. O

today O

with O 
the O

to O 
examine O 
the O 
Iranian O 
request O

in O 
the O

one O 
application O

to O 
the O 
head O 
of O

. O 

Diplomats O 
said O 
that O 
most O 
Western B-LOC 
and O 
developing O 
countries O 
in O 
the O 
Agency B-ORG 
have O 
temporarily O 
agreed O 
to O 
freeze O 
the O 
Iranian O 
request O 
, O 
because O 
of O 
fears O 
that O 
it O 
might O 
result O 
in O 
the O 
subsequent O 
production O 
of O 
plutonium O 
; O 
this O 
in O 
response O 
to O 
the O 
fears O 
of O 
the O 
developing O 
countries O 
that O 
this O 
will O 
set O 
a O 
precedent O

deprive O 
technical O 
assistance O 
to O

of O 
these O

. O 

Seven O 
other O 
requests O 
submitted O 
by O 
Tehran B-LOC 
are O 
seen O 
as O 
not O 
constituting O 
any O 
risk O 
for O 
the O 
proliferation O 
of O 
atomic O 
bombs O 
, O 
since O 
they O 
basically O 
address O 
the O 
medical O 
and O 
civilian O 
aspects O 
of O

and O 
which O 
most O 
members O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Board I-ORG 
of I-ORG

are O 
convinced O 
will O 
not O 
increase O

meeting O 
today O

in O

the B-LOC

That O

Uh O

is O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
political O

, O 
uh O 
, O 
that O 
came O 
along O

with O 
the O 
agenda O 
of O 
the O

that O

on O 
a O

by O

neighboring O 
countries O 
of O

specifically O 
here O 
Iran B-LOC

uh O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
acting O 
to O 
stir O 
up O 
sectarian O

in O

, O 

Well O 
, O 
the O 
latest O 
information O 
is O 
that O 
there O 
is O 
a O 
problem O 
in O 
the O 
area O 
of O 
Arab O 
Al B-LOC

Barbir I-LOC

uh O 
, O 
about O 
50 O 
people O 
entered O 
the O

who O 
were O 
apparently O 
returning O

going O 
to O 
it O 
, O 
to O 
the O

I O 
mean O 
, O 
do O 
you O 
have O 
according O 
to O 
the O

any O 
information O

especially O 
about O 
the O

who O 
was O 
killed O 
yesterday O 
in O

? O 

with O 
respect O 
to O 
the O 
victim O 
may O 
God O 
bless O 
his O 
soul O 
, O 
the O 
prime O 
minister O 
was O 
with O 
him O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
and O 
he O 
was O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
a O 
victim O 
of O 
all O 
that O 
is O 
happening O 
and O 
a O 
victim O 
of O 
all O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
and O 
consequently O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
there O 
is O 
a O 
military O 
investigation O 
being O 
conducted O 
by O 
the O 
military O

those O 
details O

the O

And O 
unfortunately O 
, O 
what O 
was O 
said O 
on O

station O 
that O 
the O

of O

first O 
of O 
all O 
we O 
have O 
no O

no O

we O 
in O

never O

I O 
mean O 
, O 
if O 
we O 
take O 
the O 
outcome O 
from O 
the O

that O 
took O 
place O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
over O 
the O 
past O 
24 O 
hours O 
, O 
especially O 
yesterday O 
evening O 
, O 
we O 
see O 
where O 
they O 
take O 
place O 
and O 
who O 
suffers O 
the O 
damage O 
, O 
we O 
discover O 
uh O 
, O 
that O 
they O 
occur O 
more O 
in O

a O

belonging O

to O 
give O 
more O

because O 
by O 
the O

there O 
is O 
a O 
very O 
big O 
chance O 
for O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
, O 
the O 
Lebanese O 
economy O 
would O 
improve O 
, O 
the O 
living O 
conditions O

improve O

the O

I O

, O 
Hajj B-PER

how O

you O

How O 
do O 
you O 
in O

it O 
? O 

I O 
mean O 
, O 
to O 
begin O 
with O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
I O 
would O 
like O 
to O 
say O 
that O 
what O 
happened O 
yesterday O 
was O 
a O 
historic O 
referendum O 
in O 
the O 
history O 
of O

I O 
mean O 
, O 
after O

, O 
can O 
we O 
say O 
there O 
is O 
any O 
progress O 
in O 
the O 
air O 
? O 

Well O 
, O 
matter O 
of O 
fact O 
, O 
is O 
that O 
if O 
the O 
decision O 
were O 
left O 
to O 
the O 
ruling O 
party O 
in O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
, O 
perhaps O 
there O 
would O 
be O 
a O 
possibility O 
of O 
success O 
for O 
the O 
Arab O 
initiative O 
. O 

Instead O 
, O 
the O 
key O 
to O 
the O 
solution O 
right O 
now O 
is O 
in O 
the B-LOC 
United I-LOC 
States I-LOC 
of I-LOC 
America I-LOC 
. O 

And O 
since O 
the O 
American O 
orientation O 
so O 
far O 
has O 
not O 
been O 
completely O 
elaborated O 
, O 
especially O 
after O 
, O 
the O 
Baker B-PER 
- O 
Hamilton B-PER 
report O 
, O 
in O 
my O 
estimation O 
, O 
the O 
situation O 
in O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
will O 
remain O 
pending O 
the O 
clarification O 
of O 
perceptions O 
that O 
the O 
American O 
administration O 
wants O 
to O 
adopt O 
at O 
the O 
level O 
of O 
the O 
region O 
as O 
a O 
whole O 
. O 

Consequently O 
, O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
in O 
this O 
situation O 
does O 
not O 
, O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
represent O 
an O 
independent O 
issue O 
for O 
the O 
American O 
administration O 
as O 
much O 
as O 
it O 
is O 
an O 
arena O 
or O 
a O 
pressure O 
card O 
through O 
which O 
it O 
wants O 
to O 
deal O 
with O 
the O 
other O 
relevant O 
parties O 
in O 
the O 
region O 
. O 

Who O 
is O 
it O 
that O 
today O 
wants O 
to O 
blow O 
things O 
up O 
in O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
, O 
Doctor O 
? O 

Uh O 
, O 
obviously O 
, O 
Israel B-LOC 
has O 
never O 
in O 
its O 
history O 
encountered O 
, O 
since O 
it O 
came O 
into O 
existence O 
until O 
today O 
, O 
a O 
resistance O 
like O 
the O 
resistance O 
it O 
met O 
in O 
this O 
war O 
. O 

And O 
to O 
this O 
day O 
, O 
we O 
still O 
hear O 
the O 
repercussions O 
within O 
Israel B-LOC 
. O 

Let O 
me O 
go O 
back O 
a O 
little O 
to O 
the O 
creation O 
of O 
Israel B-LOC 
. O 

Israel B-LOC 
and O 
the O 
Arab O 
countries O 
have O 
been O 
close O 
to O 
each O 
other O 
during O 
the O 
time O 
of O 
their O 
existence O 
, O 
about O 
50 O 
or O 
60 O 
years O 
. O 

And O 
during O 
those O 
years O 
, O 
Israel B-LOC 
waged O 
well O 
coordinated O 
wars O 
, O 
in O 
which O 
it O 
was O 
victorious O 
because O 
of O 
the O 
unlimited O 
support O 
it O 
received O 
from O 
the O 
superpowers O 
. O 

But O 
what O 
Israel B-LOC 
did O 
not O 
fail O 
to O 
observe O 
was O 
that O 
the O 
societal O 
war O 
, O 
if O 
it O 
were O 
able O 
to O 
wage O 
it O 
and O 
destroy O 
Arab O 
society O 
from O 
the O 
inside O 
, O 
then O 
it O 
would O 
have O 
the O 
final O 
victory O 
. O 

Therefore O 
, O 
Israel B-LOC 
understands O 
this O 
premise O 
and O 
it O 
wants O 
to O 
dismantle O 
societies O 
from O 
the O 
inside O 
. O 

This O 
leads O 
naturally O 
to O 
the O 
fact O 
that O 
someone O 
in O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
is O 
working O 
for O 
the O 
benefit O 
of O 
Israeli O 
interests O 
, O 
someone O 
working O 
for O 
the O 
interests O 
of O 
Israel B-LOC 
. O 

I O 
will O 
come O 
back O 
once O 
more O 
uh O 
, O 
to O 
listen O 
to O 
, O 
uh O

Mr. O

Your O 
Excellency O

Minister O

the O

warned O 
against O 
descending O 
into O 
the O 
street O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
previously O 
, O 
that O 
there O 
would O 
be O 
another O 
street O 
and O 
there O 
might O 
be O 
provocations O 
and O 
friction O 
that O 
may O 
lead O 
to O 
disastrous O 
consequences O 
in O 
Lebanon B-LOC 
. O 

in O 
our O 
personal O 
judgment O 
, O 
to O 
threaten O 
one O 
street O 
with O 
another O 
street O 
, O 
which O 
was O 
issued O 
by O 
some O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
mouthpieces O 
of O 
the O 
authorities O 
and O 
some O 
figures O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
of O 
the O 
parliamentary O 
majority O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
its O 
purpose O 
was O 
to O 
stir O 
up O 
agitation O 
in O 
the O 
path O 
of O 
the O 
opposition O 
and O 
, O 
as O 
a O 
result O 
, O 
to O 
be O 
satisfied O 
and O 
not O 
resort O 
to O 
expressing O 
itself O 
through O 
this O 
huge O 
phenomenon O 
that O 
is O 
taking O 
place O 
in O

despite O 
all O 
that O

there O 
is O 
still O 
some O

in O 
some O 
way O

another O

on O

I O 
mean O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
could O 
an O 
attractive O 
offer O 
come O

, O 
that O 
would O 
urge O 
Speaker O 
Nabih B-PER

to O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
call O 
once O 
again O 
upon O 
the O

Uh O 
, O 
Abir B-PER 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
the B-ORG

mainly O 
tried O 
to O 
manipulate O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
Shiite O 
bilateralism O

thinking O 
there O 
could O 
be O 
certain O 
differences O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
or O 
political O 
diversity O 
, O 
or O 
paradoxes O 
, O 
or O 
possibly O 
political O 
differences O 
between O 
Speaker O 
Berri B-PER 
on O 
the O 
one O 
hand O 
and O 
the O 
resistance O 
and O 
Mr. O 
Nasrallah B-PER 
on O 
the O 
other O 
. O 

Speaker O 
Berri B-PER 
had O 
pointed O 
out O 
at O 
the O 
dialog O 
table O 
and O 
at O 
the O 
discussion O 
table O 
that O 
although O 
he O 
may O 
be O 
adopting O 
an O 
initiative O 
calling O 
for O 
unity O 
, O 
at O 
the O 
end O 
of O 
the O 
day O 
he O 
is O 
an O 
involved O 
party O 
and O 
will O 
remain O 
so O 
. O 

Speaker O 
Berri B-PER 
, O 
today O 
, O 
and O 
until O 
the O 
last O 
moments O 
of O 
the O 
divorce O 
kept O 
saying O 
that O 
the O 
marriage O 
could O 
still O 
be O 
patched O 
up O 
, O 
the O 
combination O 
of O 
national O 
accord O 
and O 
dialog O 
were O 
still O 
possible O 
, O 
but O 
when O 
all O 
these O 
windows O 
were O 
closed O 
, O 
the O 
final O 
cure O 
was O 
cauterization O 
, O 
as O 
you O 
mentioned O 
at O 
the O 
beginning O 
of O 
the O 
episode O 
. O 

Of O 
course O 
, O 
today O 
there O 
have O 
been O 
attempts O 
to O 
revive O 
Speaker O 
Berri B-PER 
's O 
role O 
in O 
this O 
direction O 
, O 
but O 
let O 
's O 
admit O 
that O 
what O 
's O 
going O 
on O 
today O 
in O 
Martyr B-LOC

, O 
as O 
well O 
as O 
all O 
the O 
Lebanese O 
parties O 
involved O

I O 
do O 
n't O 
know O 
what O 
form O 
Speaker O 
Berri B-PER 
's O 
possible O 
initiative O 
might O 
take O 
; O 
however O 
, O 
under O 
the O 
weight O 
of O 
these O 
two O 
demands O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
impossible O 
for O 
Speaker O 
Berri B-PER 
to O 
make O 
any O 
new O 
moves O 
. O

I O 
suspect O

A O

Further O 
a O

Finally O 
there O 
are O 
no O 
witnesses O 
or O 
other O 
evidence O 
to O 
support O 
Littlejohn B-PER

claim O 
that O

problem O 
of O

is O 
that O

told O 
the O

that O 
he O 
hardly O 
even O

right O

Janna B-PER

this O 
defense O

out O

you O 
know O 
talking O

big O 
game O

saying O 
I O

got O 
a O 
solid O 
defense O 
here O

And O 
that O 
could O 
work O 
in O 
this O 
case O 
Dan B-PER

we O 
do O

have O 
a O

you O

you O 
're O 
ignoring O 
all O 
the O 
evidence O 
that O 
Ray B-PER

explaining O

if O 
the O 
theory O 
is O 
that O 
she O

killed O 
why O 
is O 
n't O 
Littlejohn B-PER 
's O 
DNA O 
all O 
over O 
her O 
body O

eh O 
It O 
's O 
highly O 
unlikely O 
Dan B-PER

Gail B-PER 
this O 
is O 
what O

do O 
/. O

here O

the O 
thing O 
Dan B-PER

Janna B-PER 
with O 
all O 
due O 
respect O 
this O 
is O 
/- O 

In O 
addition O 
Charles B-PER 
Heinz I-PER 
the O 
district O 
attorney O 
came O 
out O 
today O 
saying O 
that O 
they O 
're O 
only O 
twenty O 
per O 
cent O 
through O 
analyzing O 
the O 
physical O 
evidence O 
/. O 

Wait O 
Gail B-PER 
/. O 

they O 
were O 
also O 
concerned O 
that O 
other O 
cases O 
which O 
they O 
think O 
that O 
Littlejohn B-PER 
might O 
be O 
linked O 
to O 
were O 
cases O 
where O 
the O 
rapist O 
uh O 
forced O 
the O 
women O 
to O 
clean O 
themselves O 
off O

And O 
Littlejohn B-PER 
whether O 
he O 
's O 
a O 
rapist O 
or O 
a O 
drug O 
dealer O 
or O 
whatever O 
he O 
is O 
a O 
career O 
criminal O 
/. O 

And O 
what O 
's O 
more O 
important O 
Dan B-PER 
is O 
that O 
he O 
's O 
charged O

first O 
degree O 
murder O

attorney O

Rita B-PER

show O 
uh O 
last O 
night O 
saying O 
that O 
his O 
client O 
took O 
the O 
subway O

night O 
/. O 

Has O 
Danny B-PER 
Dorian I-PER 
been O 
called O 
in O 
to O 
witness O 
yet O 
/? O 

but O 
the O 
problem O 
Gail B-PER 
Abramson I-PER 
is O 
it O 
is O 
a O 
crime O 
if O 
the O 
bar O 
manager O 
lied O 
to O 
the O 
authorities O 
about O 
what O 
happened O 
led O 
them O 
on O 
a O 
wild O 
goose O 
chase O

but O 
in O 
the O 
state O 
of O 
New B-LOC 
York I-LOC 
you O 
're O 
not O 
allowed O 
to O 
simply O 
tell O 
the O 
authorities O 
something O 
that O 
's O 
not O 
true O 
and O 
send O 
them O 
going O 
elsewhere O 
/. O 

Number O 
one O 
he O 
's O 
going O 
to O 
argue O 
that O 
he O 
had O 
no O 
idea O 
that O 
Darryl B-PER 
Littlejohn I-PER 
aka O 
B O 
as O 
he O 
is O 
known O 
at O 
the O 
bar O 
was O 
on O 
parole O 
and O 
was O 
not O 
allowed O 
to O 
be O 
working O 
there O

Remember O 
there O 
was O 
another O 
bouncer O 
that O 
they O 
called O 
Kwan B-PER 
that O 
never O 
showed O 
up O 
again O 
either O

Yeah O 
But O 
David B-PER 
Golden I-PER 
that O 
's O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
hard O 
argument O 
to O 
make O

right O 
/? O 

It O 
's O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
tough O 
argument O 
in O 
part O 
because O 
the O 
original O 
story O 
that O 
the O 
bar O 
manager O 
told O 
cops O 
was O 
that O 
he O 
'd O 
seen O 
Imette B-PER

alone O

then O 
how O 
would O 
you O

really O 
represents O 
something O

I O 
really O 
think O

the O

well O 
let O 
me O 
ask O 
you O 
this O 
about O 
the O 
nature O

It O 
is O 
a O 
question O

he O 
can O 
push O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
agenda O

but O 
the O 
bottom O 
line O 
is O 
that O 
this O 
is O 
not O 
an O 
administration O 
that O 
thinks O 
very O 
highly O 
of O

and O 
the O 
only O 
real O

think O 
Bolton B-PER

have O 
gotten O 
more O 
than O 
fifty O

six O 
votes O

so O 
a O 
majority O 
of O 
the O 
Senate B-ORG 
supported O 
John B-PER 
Bolton I-PER 
/. O 

Senate B-ORG 
procedure O 
allows O 
a O 
minority O 
to O 
block O 
this O 
nomination O 
/. O 

Chris B-PER 
two O 
other O 
things O 
/. O 

the O 
bottom O 
line O 
is O 
you O 
're O 
forgetting O 
there O 
's O 
a O 
conference O 
on O 
UN B-ORG 
reform O 
major O 
conference O 
September O 
fourteenth O

the O 
sixteenth O

Let O 
's O 
listen O 
to O 
Senator O

former O 
Majority O 
leader O 
Trent B-PER 
Lott I-PER 
of O 
Mississippi B-LOC 
the O 
United B-LOC

senator O

that O 
state O

Here O 
's O 
what O 
he O 
said O 
that O 
he O 
opposed O 
the O 
recess O 
appointment O 
of O 
uh O 
John B-PER 
Bolton I-PER 
/. O 

What O 
do O 
you O 
make O 
of O 
that O 
Senator O 
Coleman B-PER

I O 
disagree O 
with O 
my O 
friend O 
and O 
respected O 
colleague O 
Trent B-PER 
Lott I-PER 
/. O 

This O 
UN B-ORG 
is O 
reeling O 
from O 
the O 
aftermath O 
of O 
the O 
investigation O 
that O 
we O 
've O 
done O

the O 
sexual O

Uh O 
hopefully O 
get O 
a B-PER 
John I-PER

who O 
can O 
force O 
the O 
Chinese O

Zimbabwe B-LOC

Sudan B-LOC

understand O 
that O 
we O 
have O 
got O 
to O 
get O 
rid O 
of O 
the O 
odious O 
Human B-ORG

Eh O 
George B-PER 
Bush I-PER

only O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
in O

a O 
couple O 
more O 
years O

Uh O 
John B-PER 
Bolton I-PER 
will O 
be O 
there O 
during O 
probably O 
the O 
most O 
important O 
time O 
for O 
the B-ORG 
United I-ORG

many O 
many O

Do O 
you O 
think O 
there O 
's O 
a O 
value O 
in O 
itself O 
in O 
having O 
someone O 
to O 
go O 
up O 
there O

just O 
waste O 
the O

I O 
mean O 
in O 
other O

just O 
give O 
tough O

humiliate O

try O 
to O 
get O 
them O 
out O

get O 
them O 
straightened O 
out O 
by O 
just O 
making O 
fun O

by O 
basically O 
trashing O 
some O 
of O 
those O 
Third B-LOC

have O 
contributed O 
to O 
this O 
uh O 
horror O 
in O 
some O 
of O 
these O 
cases O 
you O 
mentioned O

uh O 
I O 
do O 
n't O 
think O 
there O 
's O 
any O 
basis O 
for O 
saying O 
that O 
's O 
what O 
John B-PER 
Bolton I-PER 
is O 
going O 
to O 
do O 
/. O 

John B-PER 
Bolton I-PER 
by O 
the O 
way O 
was O 
a O 
very O 
effective O 
assistant O 
of O 
state O

He O 
helped O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
get O 
rid O 
of O 
its O 
odious O 
Zionism O 
is O 
racism O

in O 
nineteen O 
ninety O

one O 
when O 
people O 
said O 
that O 
could O 
n't O 
be O 
done O

So O 
do O 
n't O 
underestimate O 
the O 
skill O 
of O 
John B-PER

UN B-ORG

I O

it O 
would O

John B-PER

Chris B-PER 
Chris B-PER

everything O 
that O 
John B-PER

there O

your O

John B-PER

speaking O

the O

what O 
Brabara B-PER

On O 
the O

John B-PER 
Bolton I-PER 
has O 
showed O 
the O 
ability O 
to O 
do O 
that O

Did O 
it O 
bother O 
you O 
that O 
when O 
he O 
filled O 
out O

uh O 
before O 
your O

Do O 
you O 
think O 
the O

can O 
still O 
play O 
the O 
role O 
that O 
FDR B-PER

Chris B-PER 
I O 
hope O 
so O

I O 
think O 
that O

the O 
importance O

this O 
whole O

That O 
's O 
what O 
this O

about O

do O 
have O 
to O

We O 
have O 
to O 
change O 
the O 
focus O

the O 
UN B-ORG

they O 
're O 
not O 
spending O 
one O

sixty O

nine O 
million O

twenty O

four O 
million O

their O

If O 
it O 
does O 
that O 
then O 
in O

the O 
UN B-ORG 
can O 
live O 
out O 
what O 
it O 
was O 
supposed O

I O 
'd O 
like O

Andrea B-PER 
there O 
are O 
two O 
paradigms O 
for O 
UN B-ORG 
ambassador O 
/. O 

There O 
's O 
Adlai B-PER 
Stevenson I-PER 
the O 
old O 
liberal O 
who O 
really O 
came O 
through O 
during O 
the O 
Cuban O 
Missile O 
Crisis O 
because O 
everybody O 
in O 
the O 
world O 
believed O 
he O 
was O 
n't O 
a O 
hawk O 
/. O 

And O 
then O 
there O 
was O 
Daniel B-PER 
Patrick I-PER 
Moynihan I-PER 
who O 
went O 
over O 
there O 
and O 
took O 
on O 
the B-LOC 
Third I-LOC 
World I-LOC 
on O 
issues O 
like O 
uh O 
the O 
issues O 
of O 
anti-Israel B-LOC 
sort O 
of O 
rhetoric O 
over O 
there O 
and O 
he O 
won O 
those O 
battles O 
/. O 

And O 
he O 
ca O 
n't O 
go O 
in O 
with O 
a O 
mandate O 
that O 
the O 
president O 
has O 
given O 
him O 
to O 
shake O 
the O 
place O 
up O 
with O 
some O 
of O 
those O 
pungent O 
sound O 
bites O 
and O 
get O 
along O 
with O 
enough O 
people O 
especially O 
because O 
his O 
own O 
credibility O 
was O 
really O 
on O 
the O 
line O 
on O 
some O 
of O 
the O 
tough O 
issues O 
that O 
he O 
's O 
going O 
to O 
confront O 
Iran B-LOC 
Iraq B-LOC 
North B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
/. O 

That O 
said O 
John B-PER 
Bolton I-PER 
has O 
experience O 
/. O 

He O 
was O 
very O 
successful O 
in O 
a O 
previous O 
incarnation O 
in O 
New B-LOC 
York I-LOC 
when O 
he O 
was O 
able O 
to O 
defeat O 
the O 
Zionism O 
is O 
racism O 
uh O 
resolution O 
there O 
back O 
then O 
/. O 

Sure O 
but O 
Kofi B-PER 
Annan I-PER 
look O 
does O 
n't O 
have O 
a O 
whole O 
lot O 
of O 
strength O 
himself O 
especially O 
with O 
critics O 
here O 
in O 
the B-LOC 
United I-LOC 
States I-LOC 
/. O 

So O 
while O 
he O 
would O 
like O 
to O 
warn O 
John B-PER 
Bolton I-PER 
as O 
he O 
did O 
today O 
that O 
there O 
are O 
a O 
hundred O 
ninety O 
other O 
representatives O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
has O 
a O 
certain O 
special O 
clout O

and O 
Annan B-PER 
is O 
going O 
to O 
have O 
to O 
listen O 
to O 
him O 
/. O 

Uh O 
I O 
guess O 
that O 
if O 
Bolton B-PER 
had O 
not O 
said O 
some O 
of O 
the O 
things O 
that O 
he O 
had O 
said O 
in O 
the O 
past O 
that O 
you O 
know O 
the O 
UN B-ORG 
secretariat O 
has O 
thirty O 
- O 
eight O 
floors O 
and O 
you O 
could O 
lose O 
ten O 
of O 
them O 
without O 
losing O 
anything O 
those O 
kinds O 
of O 
quotes O 
are O 
going O 
to O 
kind O 
of O 
haunt O 
him O 
/. O 

Do O 
you O 
think O 
there O 
's O 
any O 
danger O 
in O 
the O 
world O 
of O 
causing O 
a O 
real O 
war O 
in O 
North B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
again O 
another O 
Korean O 
war O 
by O 
calling O 
the O 
North O 
Korean O 
dictator O 
what O 
he O 
is O 
/? O 

Well O 
actually O 
Condi B-PER 
Rice I-PER 
herself O 
in O 
her O 
own O 
confirmation O 
hearing O 
had O 
rattled O 
that O 
cage O 
/. O 

What O 
Rice B-PER 
is O 
proving O 
as O 
secretary O 
is O 
that O 
she O 
's O 
much O 
more O 
pragmatic O 
as O 
secretary O 
of O 
state B-ORG 
than O 
she O 
was O 
a O 
national O 
security O 
adviser O 
on O 
Iran B-LOC 
and O 
on O 
North B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
/. O 

So O 
she O 
's O 
taken O 
this O 
posture O 
she O 
's O 
reflecting O 
the O 
president O 
's O 
view O 
as O 
adjusted O 
for O 
second O 
term O 
and O 
Bolton B-PER 
is O 
going O 
to O 
have O 
to O 
follow O 
that O 
line O 
/. O 

How O 
many O 
months O 
before O 
Condi B-PER 
Rice I-PER 
has O 
to O 
apologize O

defend O

Is O 
that O 
where O 
John B-PER

denied O 
him O 
an O

that O

did O 
you O 
make O 
of O 
your O

Paul B-PER

Well O 
well O 
he O 
did O 
that O 
with O

he O 
was O 
trying O

paint O 
himself O 
in O 
the O 
Cincinnati B-LOC

market O

If O 
you O 
looked O 
at O 
his O 
ad O 
he O 
aligned O 
himself O 
with O 
the O 
president O

he O 
caught O 
on O 
rather O 
quick O 
uh O 
when O 
he O 
won O 
the O 
uh O 
primary O 
election O 
and O 
he O 
had O 
gone O 
on O 
a O 
radio O

said O 
uh O 
that O 
the O 
worst O 
threat O 
to O

not O

uh O 
with O

you O

up O

for O 
those O

then O 
govern O

Mike B-PER

And O 
if O 
the B-ORG 
Republican I-ORG

uh O 
grasps O 
that O 
then O 
we O 
will O 
go O 
about O 
the O

reestablishing O 
the O 
line O

Okay O 
let O 
's O 
go O 
to O 
Sherrod B-PER

uh O 
I O 
think O 
the O 
Secretary O

your O

seems O 
like O 
he O 
's O 
trashing O

's O 
running O 
a O 
half O

what O 
happened O

right O

do O 
n't O 
know O 
what O 
Mike B-PER 
Dukakis I-PER 
has O 
to O 
do O 
with O 
it O 
/. O 

But O 
the O 
message O 
clearly O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
ethical O 
problems O 
in O 
Columbus B-LOC 
the O 
ties O 
of O 
this O 
candidate O 
that O 
barely O 
squeaked O 
through O 
this O 
election O 
when O 
George B-PER 
Bush I-PER 
carried O 
that O 
district O 
two O 
to O 
one O

the O 
former O

carried O 
it O 
almost O 
three O 
to O 
one O 
the O

she O 
had O

What O 
does O 
that O 
mean O 
in O

I O 
would O

want O 
to O 
be O 
on O 
the O

next O

I O 
were O

you O 
associate O

the O 
remarks O

uh O 
Paul B-PER 
Hackett I-PER

fellow O

lost O 
the O

to O 
the O 
President O

the B-LOC 
United I-LOC

I O 
think O 
that O 
uh O 
Mr. O

Considering O 
he O 
was O

he O 
did O

a O

has O 
heard O

disagree O 
with O 
his O 
war O

Paul B-PER 
Hackett I-PER

I O 
think O 
whatever O 
Mr. O 
Hackett B-PER 
said O 
was O 
understandable O 
/. O 

But O 
the O 
issue O 
is O 
that O 
Paul B-PER 
Hackett I-PER 
ran O 
incredibly O 
well O 
when O 
George B-PER 
Bush I-PER 
put O 
his O 
name O

Bob B-PER

me O 
just O 
say O 
to O 
you O

what O

uh O 
it O 
would O 
answer O 
the O 
question O 
that O 
Mr. O

raised O 
about O

uh O 
it O 
was O

if O 
he O 
was O 
using O

during O 
his O 
testimony O

prior O

testimony O

he O 
has O

mislead O 
the O 
Congress B-ORG

uh O 
his O 
defense O 
or O 
the O 
defense O 
that O 
Canseco B-PER 
offered O 
on O 
this O 
show O 
last O 
night O 
was O 
that O 
he O 
may O 
have O 
used O 
them O

ago O 
in O 
other O 
words O 
before O 
he O 
testified O

he O

guilty O 
of O 
perjury O

I O

not O 
sure O 
if O 
Canseco B-PER

just O 
offering O 
his O 
opinion O 
uh O 
uh O 
/. O 

Certainly O 
Palmeiro B-PER 
never O 
contested O 
the O 
positive O 
result O 
on O 
the O

do O

anything O

Is O 
it O 
fair O 
to O

saying O

the O 
point O

that O

what O

President O 
has O 
had O 
those O 
kinds O 
of O 
views O 
they O 
keep O 
running O 
into O 
brick O 
walls O 
In O 
this O 
case O 
a B-ORG 
Supreme I-ORG 
Court I-ORG 
that O 
has O 
generally O 
been O 
sympathetic O 
to O 
executive O 
power O 
/. O 

Well O 
let O 
's O 
break O 
it O 
down O 
here O 
Because O 
this O 
ruling O 
does O 
indicate O 
to O 
some O 
human O 
rights O 
groups O 
that O 
this O 
applies O 
to O 
the O 
prisoners O 
in O 
secret O 
CIA B-ORG 
prisons O 
to O 
the O 
prisoners O 
in O 
Afghanistan B-LOC 
Beyond O 
Guantanamo B-LOC 
/. O 

Are O 
we O 
going O 
to O 
see O 
a O 
flood O 
of O 
habeas O 
corpus O 
petitions O 
now O 
Senator O 
McConnell B-PER 
/? O 

And O 
I O 
'm O 
pleased O 
to O 
hear O 
that O 
Chuck B-PER 
thinks O 
that O 
we O 
may O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
do O 
this O 
on O 
a O 
bipartisan O 
basis O 
/. O 

The O 
Court B-ORG 
now O 
has O 
stepped O 
eh O 
eh O 
into O 
the O 
field O 
And O 
said O 
we O 
must O 
create O 
these O 
commissions O 
/. O 

The O 
good O 
news O 
Andrea B-PER 
is O 
that O 
the O 
Court B-ORG 
particularly O 
Breyer B-PER 
's O 
decision O 
said O 
Congress B-ORG 
could O 
change O 
the O 
rules O 
/. O 

We O 
're O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
far O 
worse O 
off O 
than O 
if O 
the O 
administration O 
had O 
come O 
to O 
Congress B-ORG 
originally O 
and O 
gotten O 
this O 
done O 
/. O 

But O 
and O 
I O 
do O 
n't O 
agree O 
with O 
Mitch B-PER 
here O 
This O 
view O 
that O 
the O 
President O 
has O 
the O 
sole O 
right O 
based O 
on O 
the O 
use O 
of O 
military O 
force O 
doctrine O 
when O 
none O 
of O 
this O 
was O 
even O 
discussed O 
or O 
mentioned O 
is O 
the O 
wrong O 
view O 
/. O 

and O 
the B-ORG 
Supreme I-ORG 
Court I-ORG 
said O 
it O 
/. O 

Andrea B-PER 
could O 
I O 
just O 
/- O 

Senator O 
McConnell B-PER 
should O 
Guantanamo B-LOC 
now O 
just O 
be O 
closed O 
/? O 

Look O 
I O 
think O 
the O 
Congress B-ORG 
is O 
very O 
very O 
likely O 
to O 
give O 
the O 
President O 
exactly O 
what O 
he O 
thinks O 
he O 
needs O 
to O 
continue O 
to O 
fight O 
the O 
war O 
on O 
terror O 
/. O 

But O 
is O 
this O 
Court B-ORG 
ruling O 
a O 
strong O 
signal O 
to O 
the B-ORG 
White I-ORG 
House I-ORG 
that O 
it O 
should O 
now O 
agree O 
with O 
Senator O 
McCain B-PER 
Senator O 
Lindsey B-PER 
Graham I-PER 
and O 
others O 
in O 
your O 
party O 
who O 
believe O 
that O 
it O 
should O 
go O 
along O 
with O 
the O 
Geneva O 
Convention O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
rules O 
of O 
the O 
road O 
for O 
our O 
soldiers O 
/? O 

I O 
think O 
Congress B-ORG 
is O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
very O 
reluctant O 
to O 
subject O 
American O 
military O 
people O 
to O 
potential O 
war O 
crimes O 
uh O 
violations O 
/. O 

So O 
John B-PER 
McCain I-PER 
is O 
wrong O 
on O 
this O 
/? O 

My O 
guess O 
is O 
that O 
the O 
Congress B-ORG 
is O 
very O 
likely O 
to O 
give O 
the O 
President O 
what O 
he O 
thinks O 
he O 
needs O 
the O 
tools O 
he O 
thinks O 
he O 
needs O 
to O 
protect O 
us O 
here O 
at O 
home O 
/. O 

I O 
think O 
that O 
there O 
will O 
be O 
a O 
careful O 
looking O 
again O 
at O 
what O 
certain O 
due O 
process O 
elements O 
are O 
that O 
the O 
Constitution O 
and O 
the B-ORG 
Supreme I-ORG 
Court I-ORG 
has O 
required O 
in O 
the O 
past O 
/. O 

But O 
there O 
's O 
one O 
other O 
thing O 
that O 
ought O 
to O 
be O 
done O 
Andrea B-PER 
given O 
the O 
sweeping O 
nature O 
of O 
this O 
decision O 
not O 
so O 
much O 
on O 
the O 
specifics O 
of O 
what O 
can O 
be O 
done O 
But O 
on O 
how O 
it O 
ought O 
to O 
be O 
done O 
/. O 

I O 
've O 
sent O 
a O 
letter O 
today O 
to O 
Attorney O 
General O 
Gonzales B-PER 
asking O 
that O 
they O 
do O 
a O 
review O 
now O 
in O 
light O 
of O 
this O 
decision O 
of O 
all O 
their O 
other O 
abrogations O 
of O 
power O 
So O 
we O 
avoid O 
this O 
mess O 
again O 
two O 
years O 
later O 
on O 
these O 
other O 
issues O 
Whether O 
it O

everything O

I O 
think O 
what O 
the O 
American O 
people O 
want O 
is O 
for O 
the O 
Congress B-ORG 
to O 
hold O 
the O

Now O 
we O 
did O 
present O 
an O 
alternative O

A O 
minority O

a O

I O 
think O 
what O 
the O

most O 
upset O

the O 
Republican O

with O 
all O

has O

this O

what O 
Senator O

What O 
kind O 
of O 
situation O 
will O 
Japan B-LOC 
find O 
itself O 
in O 
at O 
the O 
APEC B-ORG 
summit O 
? O 

What O 
heavy O 
prices O 
will O 
Japan B-LOC 
pay O 
for O 
Koizumi B-PER 
's O

The O 
APEC B-ORG 
meeting O 
is O 
being O 
held O 
these O 
days O 
in O 
Pusan B-LOC 
, I-LOC 
South I-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
. O 

Japanese O 
Prime O 
Minister O 
Junichiro B-PER 
Koizumi I-PER 
also O 
arrived O 
in O 
Pusan B-LOC 
this O 
afternoon O 
, O 
beginning O 
his O 
APEC B-ORG 
trip O 
this O 
time O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
prior O 
to O 
this O 
, O 
many O 
analysts O 
all O 
think O 
that O 
during O 
his O 
trip O 
to O 
the O 
APEC B-ORG 
meeting O 
in O 
Pusan B-LOC 
, O 
this O 
time O 
, O 
Junichiro B-PER 
Koizumi I-PER 
may O 
likely O 
be O 
isolated O 
by O 
various O 
parties O 
. O 

The O 
reason O 
is O 
that O 
in O 
its O 
persistent O 
alignment O 
with O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
has O 
ignored O 
its O 
relations O 
with O 
other O 
countries O 
, O 
especially O 
its O 
Asian O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
. O 

What O 
is O 
clearly O 
remembered O 
by O 
its O 
Asian O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
is O 
that O 
on O 
October O 
17 O 
this O 
year O 
, O 
in O 
spite O 
of O 
opposition O 
, O 
Junichiro B-PER 
Koizumi I-PER 
stubbornly O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
visited O 
Yasukuni O 
Shrine O 
for O 
the O 
fifth O 
time O 
during O 
the O 
four O 
years O 
since O 
he O 
took O 
office O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
what O 
kind O 
of O 
situation O 
will O 
Japan B-LOC 
find O 
itself O 
in O 
at O 
the O 
APEC B-ORG 
summit O 
? O 

What O 
kind O 
of O 
impact O 
will O 
Koizumi B-PER 
's O 
lame O 
diplomacy O 
produce O 
on O 
the O 
international O 
image O 
of O 
Japan B-LOC 
? O 

We O 
have O 
invited O 
to O 
our O 
studio O 
Professor O 
Liu B-PER 
Jiangyong I-PER 
and O 
Professor O 
Jin B-PER 
Xide I-PER 
, O 
two O 
experts O 
on O 
Japan B-LOC 
issues O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
we O 
all O 
know O 
that O 
Koizumi B-PER 
arrived O 
in O 
Pusan B-LOC 
this O 
afternoon O 
. O 

In O 
the O 
afternoon O 
he O 
met O 
with O 
South O 
Korean O 
President O 
Roh B-PER 
Moo I-PER 
- I-PER 
hyun I-PER 
. O 

Ah O 
, O 
first O 
of O 
all O 
, O 
I O 
think O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
, O 
this O 
time O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
when O 
Koizumi B-PER 
arrived O 
in O 
Pusan B-LOC 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
he O 
had O 
this O 
in O 
his O 
mind O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
, O 
through O 
multilateral O 
meetings O 
, O 
he O 
attempted O 
to O 
meet O 
with O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
leaders O 
of O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
or O 
other O 
Asian O 
nations O 
, O 
Uh-huh O 
. O 
so O 
as O 
to O 
-- O 
Uh-huh O 
. O 
demonstrate O 
that O 
even O 
though O 
he O 
visited O 
Yasukuni O 
Shrine O 
, O 
Uh-huh O 
. O 
his O 
relations O 
with O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
are O 
not O 
affected O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
actually O 
, O 
today O 
President O 
Roh B-PER 
Moo I-PER 
- I-PER 
hyun I-PER 
of O 
the O 
hosting O 
country O 
of O 
the O 
meeting O 
, O 
Uh-huh O 
. O 
well O 
, O 
based O 
on O 
his O 
meeting O 
with O 
Koizumi B-PER 
, O 
I O 
think O 
, O 
actually O 
, O 
it O 
shows O 
that O 
a O 
series O 
of O 
issues O 
such O 
as O 
his O 
visit O 
to O 
Yasukuni O 
Shrine O 
have O 
indeed O 
cast O 
a O 
very O 
heavy O 
shadow O 
over O 
the O 
relations O 
between O 
the O 
two O 
countries O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
during O 
this O 
meeting O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
President O 
Roh B-PER 
Moo I-PER 
- I-PER 
hyun I-PER 
clearly O 
pointed O 
out O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
what O 
did O 
he O 
point O 
out O 
? O 
That O 
is O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
the O 
visit O 
to O 
Yasukuni O 
Shrine O 
by O 
Japanese O 
leaders O 
, O 
politicians O 
, O 
and O 
statesmen O 
, O 
is O 
a O 
, O 
, O 
provocation O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
to O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
Koizumi B-PER 
, O 
he O 
also O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
argued O 
slyly O 
for O 
himself O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
he O 
said O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
that O 
his O 
visit O 
was O 
not O 
to O 
glorify O 
the O 
war O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
, O 
originally O 
this O 
year O 
marks O 
the O 
40th O 
anniversary O 
of O 
the O 
establishment O 
of O 
diplomatic O 
relations O 
between O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
and O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

Er O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
according O 
to O 
the O 
original O 
arrangement O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
President O 
Roh B-PER 
Moo I-PER 
- I-PER 
hyun I-PER 
should O 
pay O 
a O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
at O 
the O 
end O 
of O 
this O 
year O 
. O 

Some O 
commentaries O 
said O 
that O 
when O 
Koizumi B-PER 
went O 
to O 
meet O 
with O 
Roh B-PER 
Moo I-PER 
- I-PER 
hyun I-PER 
this O 
time O 
, O 
it O 
was O 
like O 
clutching O 
at O 
a O 
straw O 
to O 
save O 
his O 
life O 
. O 

Eh O 
, O 
it O 
means O 
that O 
you O 
see O 
, O 
although O 
many O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
are O 
complaining O 
about O 
me O 
, O 
my O 
image O 
may O 
return O 
to O 
a O 
better O 
one O 
after O 
I O 
met O 
with O 
Roh B-PER 
Moo I-PER 
- I-PER 
hyun I-PER 
. O 

However O 
, O 
based O 
on O 
the O 
outcome O 
, O 
just O 
as O 
Professor O 
Liu B-PER 
introduced O 
, O 
it O 
was O 
equivalent O 
to O 
going O 
there O 
to O 
get O 
criticized O 
again O 
. O 

, O 
that O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
to O 
Prime O 
Minister O 
Koizumi B-PER 
, O 
this O 
is O 
a O 
very O 
difficult O 
diplomatic O 
journey O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
to O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
meet O 
with O 
Roh B-PER 
Moo I-PER 
- I-PER 
hyun I-PER 
was O 
originally O 
the O 
only O 
remedy O 
he O 
could O 
count O 
on O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
Roh B-PER 
Moo I-PER 
- I-PER 
hyun I-PER 
actually O 
met O 
with O 
him O 
ceremonially O 
as O 
a O 
host O 
because O 
APEC B-ORG 
held O 
the O 
meeting O 
in O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
. O 

So O 
, O 
contrary O 
to O 
Koizumi B-PER 
's O 
diplomatic O 
purpose O 
, O 
he O 
not O 
only O 
failed O 
to O 
sidestep O 
the O 
issue O 
of O 
the O 
visit O 
, O 
but O 
rather O 
exposed O 
, O 
this O 
scandal O 
to O 
the O 
entire O 
world O 
. O 

We O 
have O 
just O 
started O 
with O 
this O 
topic O 
of O 
the O 
meeting O 
between O 
President O 
Roh B-PER 
Moo I-PER 
- I-PER 
hyun I-PER 
and O 
Koizumi B-PER 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
actually O 
, O 
regarding O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
Koizumi B-PER 
's O 
attendance O 
at O 
this O 
APEC B-ORG 
summit O 
, O 
people O 
are O 
more O 
interested O 
in O 
the O 
relations O 
between O 
Japan B-LOC 
and O 
its O 
Asian O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
, O 
including O 
the O 
kind O 
of O 
alliance O 
relationship O 
between O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
and O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
so O 
on O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
speaking O 
of O 
the O 
relationship O 
issue O 
, O 
we O 
have O 
noticed O 
that O 
during O 
US B-LOC 
President O 
Bush B-PER 
's O 
visit O 
in O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
Koizumi B-PER 
made O 
some O 
declaration O 
of O 
this O 
position O 
. O 

He O 
said O 
, O 
as O 
long O 
as O 
we O 
get O 
on O 
good O 
terms O 
with O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
, O 
then O 
it O 
follows O 
naturally O 
we O 
will O 
have O 
good O 
relations O 
with O 
our O 
Asian O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
regarding O 
this O 
attitude O 
he O 
has O 
adopted O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
two O 
professors O 
, O 
how O 
would O 
you O 
look O 
at O 
Koizumi B-PER 
's O 
diplomatic O 
thinking O 
? O 

Well O 
, O 
this O 
is O 
because O 
he O 
is O 
still O 
using O 
the O 
pre-Cold O 
- O 
War O 
diplomatic O 
thinking O 
after O 
the O 
Cold O 
War O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
the B-LOC 
United I-LOC 
States I-LOC 
is O 
the O 
number O 
one O 
superpower O 
in O 
the O 
world O 
. O 

Japan B-LOC 
is O 
the O 
second O 
largest O 
economy O 
in O 
the O 
world O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
looking O 
at O 
the O 
situation O 
in O 
Asia B-LOC 
, O 
actually O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
exactly O 
the O 
other O 
way O 
round O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
if O 
it O 
does O 
not O 
get O 
on O 
good O 
terms O 
with O 
its O 
Asian O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
, O 
then O 
in O 
reality O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
will O 
become O 
even O 
more O 
hard O 
- O 
line O 
in O 
its O 
diplomacy O 
with O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

As O 
for O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
to O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
, O 
it O 
furthermore O 
has O 
lost O 
some O 
assets O 
, O 
diplomatic O 
assets O 
when O 
making O 
negotiations O 
with O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
just O 
recently O 
, O 
it O 
's O 
needless O 
for O 
us O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
that O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
relations O 
, O 
we O 
can O 
say O 
, O 
with O 
its O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
this O 
year O 
have O 
suffered O 
overall O 
deterioration O 
. O 

These O 
include O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
relations O 
with O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
, O 
China B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
Russia B-LOC 
which O 
are O 
all O 
deteriorating O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
even O 
including O 
its O 
relations O 
with O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
. O 

In O 
fact O 
, O 
, O 
even O 
today O 
, O 
we O 
also O 
noticed O 
a O 
piece O 
of O 
news O 
that O 
although O 
at O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
the O 
recent O 
two O 
- O 
plus O 
- O 
two O 
meeting O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
and O 
Japan B-LOC 
again O 
reached O 
an O 
intermediate O 
report O 
, O 
Uh-huh O 
. O 
Uh-huh O 
. O 
Uh-huh O 
. O 
Well O 
, O 
today O 
, O 
actually O 
the O 
head O 
of O 
Japan B-ORG 
's I-ORG 
Defense I-ORG 
Agency I-ORG 
again O 
mentioned O 
to O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
that O 
it O 
seems O 
to O 
feel O 
regretful O 
, O 

Because O 
, O 
according O 
to O 
the O 
two O 
- O 
plus O 
- O 
two O 
intermediate O 
report O 
just O 
reached O 
, O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
military O 
bases O 
in O 
Japan B-LOC 
should O 
undergo O 
adjustment O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
it O 
was O 
met O 
with O 
strong O 
opposition O 
from O 
the O 
general O 
public O 
in O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

So O 
, O 
now O 
the O 
JDA B-ORG 
head O 
came O 
to O 
talk O 
with O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
, O 
saying O 
, O 
whether O 
our O 
interests O 
can O 
be O 
taken O 
into O 
consideration O 
again O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
in O 
this O 
intermediate O 
report O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
, O 
between O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
and O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
centering O 
upon O 
this O 
intermediate O 
report O 
, O 
actually O 
the O 
deal O 
is O 
again O 
partially O 
completed O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
such O 
a O 
prime O 
minister O 
like O 
Koizumi B-PER 
, O 
who O 
blindly O 
follows O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
as O 
the O 
guideline O 
of O 
his O 
diplomacy O 
, O 
was O 
rarely O 
seen O 
even O 
during O 
the O 
Cold O 
War O 
era O 
. O 

We O 
know O 
that O 
in O 
1957 O 
Japan B-LOC 
had O 
three O 
diplomatic O 
principles O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
it O 
must O 
take O 
good O 
care O 
of O 
its O 
relations O 
with O 
the O 
Western O 
countries O 
, O 
Asian O 
countries O 
, O 
and O 
the B-ORG 
United I-ORG 
Nations I-ORG 
. O 

But O 
now O 
, O 
Koizumi B-PER 
is O 
like O 
a O 
stick O 
, O 
let O 
's O 
say O 
, O 
a O 
post O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
some O 
prime O 
ministers O 
before O 
Koizumi B-PER 
at O 
least O 
would O 
still O 
properly O 
deal O 
with O 
and O 
balance O 
the O 
relations O 
with O 
America B-LOC 
, O 
with O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
and O 
Asia B-LOC 
, O 
in O 
particular O 
, O 
with O 
China B-LOC 
, O 
ah O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
when O 
it O 
comes O 
to O 
Koizumi B-PER 
, O 
he O 
only O 
takes O 
good O 
care O 
of O 
the O 
relations O 
with O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
. O 

In O 
fact O 
, O 
he O 
will O 
surely O 
fail O 
to O 
take O 
good O 
care O 
of O 
the O 
relations O 
with O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
because O 
if O 
you O 
can O 
not O 
win O 
the O 
trust O 
of O 
your O 
Asian O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
, O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
will O 
not O 
fully O 
respect O 
such O 
a O 
country O 
. O 

The O 
US B-LOC 
also O 
wants O 
to O 
go O 
beyond O 
Japan B-LOC 
to O 
keep O 
good O 
relations O 
with O 
China B-LOC 
, O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
, O 
and O 
other O 
Asian O 
countries O 
. O 

Therefore O 
, O 
the O 
more O 
he O 
follows O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
, O 
the O 
lower O 
will O 
be O 
his O 
actual O 
status O 
in O 
Asia B-LOC 
. O 

Right O 
, O 
his O 
idea O 
was O 
actually O 
criticized O 
and O 
opposed O 
by O 
some O 
politicians O 
even O 
in O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

Many O 
people O 
also O 
mentioned O 
, O 
by O 
valuing O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
alone O 
, O 
you O 
are O 
ignoring O 
Asia B-LOC 
. O 

Eh O 
, O 
as O 
far O 
as O 
Koizumi B-PER 
himself O 
is O 
concerned O 
, O 
what O 
is O 
his O 
problem O 
? O 

For O 
instance O 
, O 
this O 
time O 
at O 
the O 
APEC B-ORG 
meeting O 
in O 
Pusan B-LOC 
, O 
when O 
he O 
mentioned O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
relations O 
with O 
China B-LOC 
, O 
he O 
still O 
used O 
this O 
kind O 
of O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
rhetoric O 
, O 
to O 
defend O 
himself O 
. O 

He O 
said O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
right O 
now O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
- O 
China O 
relations O 
are O 
not O 
like O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
what O 
the O 
international O 
community O 
is O 
worried O 
about O 
. O 

For O 
instance O 
, O 
from O 
January O 
to O 
August O 
this O 
year O 
, O 
the O 
latest O 
statistics O 
show O 
that O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
exports O 
to O 
China B-LOC 
grew O 
only O 
by O 
3.2 O 
% O 
according O 
to O 
China B-LOC 
's O 
statistics O 
. O 

It O 
grew O 
only O 
by O 
5.8 O 
% O 
according O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
statistics O 
. O 

In O 
other O 
words O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
exports O 
to O 
China B-LOC 
were O 
declining O 
sharply O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
at O 
the O 
same O 
time O 
, O 
with O 
respect O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
investment O 
in O 
China B-LOC 
, O 
during O 
the O 
first O 
half O 
of O 
last O 
year O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
investment O 
projects O 
in O 
China B-LOC 
decreased O 
by O 
8.2 O 
% O 
while O 
the O 
contractual O 
amount O 
decreased O 
by O 
0.4 O 
% O 
. O 

They O 
both O 
showed O 
that O 
due O 
to O 
the O 
cooling O 
down O 
of O 
the O 
political O 
relationship O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
the O 
economic O 
relations O 
between O 
China B-LOC 
and O 
Japan B-LOC 
have O 
already O 
been O 
severely O 
affected O 
. O 

Originally O 
, O 
Koizumi B-PER 
's O 
key O 
fallacy O 
for O 
his O 
visits O 
to O 
Yasukuni O 
Shrine O 
was O 
that O 
my O 
visits O 
would O 
not O 
affect O 
in O 
any O 
way O 
our O 
relations O 
with O 
Asia B-LOC 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
when O 
Koizumi B-PER 
visits O 
Yasukuni O 
Shrine O 
, O 
he O 
is O 
betting O 
on O 
the O 
national O 
interests O 
of O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

That O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
he O 
is O 
selling O 
the O 
international O 
image O 
and O 
national O 
interests O 
of O 
Japan B-LOC 
at O 
cheap O 
prices O 
. O 

Many O 
Japanese O 
people O 
also O 
see O 
that O 
this O 
does O 
not O 
conform O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
own O 
fundamental O 
interests O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
as O 
a O 
country O 
with O 
so O 
many O 
international O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
interests O 
. O 

At O 
the O 
same O 
time O 
, O 
it O 
also O 
actually O 
denigrates O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
image O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
with O 
regard O 
to O 
Koizumi B-PER 
's O 
diplomatic O 
thinking O 
, O 
there O 
is O 
still O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
one O 
question O 
. O 

Ah O 
, O 
people O 
may O 
also O 
frequently O 
ask O 
such O 
a O 
question O 
that O 
since O 
it O 
is O 
the O 
most O 
important O 
thing O 
for O 
a O 
country O 
to O 
keep O 
good O 
relationship O 
with O 
its O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
, O 
why O 
would O 
Japan B-LOC 
want O 
to O 
seek O 
far O 
and O 
wide O 
for O 
what O 
lies O 
close O 
at O 
hand O 
? O 

Well O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
this O 
Prime O 
Minister O 
Koizumi B-PER 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
first O 
of O 
all O 
, O 
personally O 
, O 
he O 
is O 
an O 
individual O 
with O 
a O 
kind O 
of O 
belief O 
, O 
a O 
very O 
rightist O 
political O 
belief O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
it O 
also O 
precisely O 
reflects O 
a O 
current O 
political O 
trend O 
of O 
forces O 
surrounding O 
the O 
Koizumi B-PER 
administration O 
. O 

It O 
also O 
reflects O 
that O 
nowadays O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
in O 
its O 
eagerness O 
to O 
become O 
a O 
political O 
power O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
wants O 
to O 
take O 
advantage O 
of O 
the O 
sentiments O 
of O 
extreme O 
nationalism O 
to O 
move O 
toward O 
and O 
realize O 
this O 
goal O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
if O 
Japan B-LOC 
wants O 
to O 
become O 
a O 
powerful O 
country O 
commanding O 
true O 
respect O 
, O 
it O 
must O 
get O 
rid O 
of O 
the O 
name O 
of O 
a O 
defeated O 
country O 
, O 
the O 
name O 
of O 
an O 
aggressor O 
country O 
in O 
World O 
War O 
II O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
this O 
road O 
he O 
takes O 
will O 
surely O 
isolate O 
Japan B-LOC 
from O 
the O 
international O 
community O 
and O 
will O 
definitely O 
not O 
make O 
it O 
a O 
political O 
power O 
in O 
the O 
end O 
. O 

For O 
example O 
, O 
regarding O 
his O 
visits O 
to O 
Yasukuni O 
Shrine O 
, O 
, O 
he O 
says O 
, O 
if O 
I O 
, O 
keep O 
doing O 
it O 
like O 
this O 
, O 
China B-LOC 
, O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
you O 
will O 
, O 
grow O 
tired O 
of O 
protesting O 
. O 

He O 
did O 
not O 
know O 
this O 
issue O 
could O 
bring O 
big O 
trouble O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
we O 
can O 
say O 
that O 
an O 
overall O 
review O 
of O 
the O 
current O 
diplomatic O 
status O 
of O 
Japan B-LOC 
should O 
show O 
two O 
clear O 
roads O 
. O 

Ha O 
, O 
one O 
is O 
to O 
follow O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
blindly O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
one O 
of O 
its O 
very O 
important O 
diplomatic O 
lines O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
speaking O 
of O 
this O 
, O 
we O 
can O 
also O 
figure O 
out O 
that O 
Koizumi B-PER 
has O 
seriously O 
damaged O 
the O 
feelings O 
of O 
his O 
Asian O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
several O 
times O 
since O 
he O 
took O 
office O 
as O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
prime O 
minister O 
in O 
2001 O 
. O 

In O 
February O 
2005 O 
, O 
just O 
one O 
day O 
after O 
Chinese O 
people O 
's O 
traditional O 
Spring O 
Festival O 
, O 
the O 
Japanese O 
government O 
claimed O 
the O 
lighthouse O 
set O 
on O 
Diaoyu B-LOC 
Island I-LOC 
by O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
extreme O 
rightist O 
group O 
without O 
permission O 
as O 
its O 
national O 
property O 
and O 
put O 
in O 
under O 
the O 
administration O 
of O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

On O 
March O 
16 O 
, O 
2005 O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
Shimane B-LOC 
Prefecture I-LOC 
assembly O 
voted O 
to O 
pass O 
a O 
measure O 
bill O 
concerning O 
Takeshima O 
Day O 
and O 
officially O 
designated O 
February O 
22 O 
as O 
Takeshima O 
Day O 
. O 

As O 
a O 
result O 
, O 
this O 
small O 
island O 
just O 
a O 
bit O 
over O 
90 O 
kilometers O 
from O 
Utsuryo B-LOC 
Island I-LOC 
, O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
, O 
again O 
triggered O 
a O 
diplomatic O 
conflict O 
between O 
the O 
two O 
countries O 
. O 

South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
thinks O 
that O 
this O 
island O 
called O 
Dokdo B-LOC 
Island I-LOC 
has O 
always O 
been O 
a O 
Korean O 
territory O 
. O 

On O 
April O 
1 O 
, O 
2005 O 
, O 
the O 
Japanese O 
Ministry B-ORG 
of I-ORG 
Education I-ORG 
approved O 
a O 
new O 
edition O 
of O 
history O 
textbooks O 
compiled O 
by O 
the O 
new O 
history O 
textbook O 
compilation O 
committee O 
and O 
published O 
by O 
Fusosha B-ORG 
Publishing I-ORG 
House I-ORG 
and O 
announced O 
the O 
result O 
officially O 
on O 
April O 
5 O 
. O 

Instead O 
the O 
Japanese O 
claims O 
of O 
sovereignty O 
of O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
's I-LOC 
Dokdo B-LOC 
Island I-LOC 
and O 
China B-LOC 
's O 
Diaoyu B-LOC 
Island I-LOC 
were O 
added O 
. O 

Eh O 
, O 
at O 
that O 
time O 
, O 
he O 
pledged O 
to O 
reform O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
internal O 
political O 
and O 
economic O 
situations O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
right O 
now O 
, O 
another O 
important O 
question O 
is O 
how O 
exactly O 
people O 
in O 
Japan B-LOC 
view O 
Koizumi B-PER 
's O 
diplomatic O 
or O 
internal O 
policies O 
, O 
Professor O 
Jin B-PER 
? O 

Well O 
, O 
we O 
know O 
that O 
among O 
major O 
Japanese O 
newspapers O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
the O 
most O 
dominant O 
newspapers O 
expressing O 
popular O 
opinions O 
, O 
ranging O 
from O 
Asahi B-ORG 
Shimbun I-ORG 
to O 
Tokyo B-ORG 
Shimbun I-ORG 
, O 
etc O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
recently O 
, O 
even O 
Yomiuri B-ORG 
Simbun I-ORG 
, O 
which O 
originally O 
expressed O 
support O 
for O 
Koizumi B-PER 
's O 
right O 
- O 
wing O 
tendencies O 
, O 
has O 
started O 
to O 
change O 
sides O 
. O 

This O 
has O 
been O 
opposed O 
by O 
the B-ORG 
Liberal I-ORG 
Democratic I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
and O 
all O 
opposition O 
parties O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
we O 
know O 
that O 
the O 
most O 
important O 
pillar O 
in O 
Japan B-LOC 
that O 
supports O 
the O 
Japanese O 
society O 
is O 
the O 
Japanese O 
business O 
community O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
the O 
heads O 
of O 
several O 
groups O 
in O 
the O 
business O 
community O 
, O 
for O 
instance O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
Japan I-ORG 
Business I-ORG 
Federation I-ORG 
and O 
the B-ORG 
Japan I-ORG 
Committee I-ORG 
for I-ORG 
Economic I-ORG 
Development I-ORG 
, O 
all O 
had O 
frequent O 
direct O 
meetings O 
with O 
Koizumi B-PER 
, O 
strongly O 
cautioning O 
him O 
not O 
to O 
visit O 
Yasukuni O 
Shrine O 
, O 
Uh-huh O 
. O 
Uh-huh O 
. O 
because O 
our O 
economy O 
will O 
suffer O 
if O 
our O 
Japan B-LOC 
can O 
not O 
survive O 
in O 
the O 
international O 
community O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
we O 
have O 
noticed O 
that O 
in O 
response O 
to O 
such O 
questions O 
, O 
some O 
analysts O 
recently O 
noted O 
that O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
diplomacy O 
will O 
pay O 
a O 
heavy O 
price O 
for O 
what O 
he O 
has O 
been O 
doing O 
. O 

As O 
a O 
matter O 
of O 
fact O 
, O 
Professor O 
Liu B-PER 
, O 
you O 
also O 
mentioned O 
earlier O 
that O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
economy O 
, O 
for O 
instance O 
, O 
the O 
Sino O 
- O 
Japanese O 
trade O 
, O 
has O 
already O 
been O 
affected O 
to O 
some O 
extent O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
I O 
think O 
, O 
actually O 
, O 
as O 
far O 
as O 
Japan B-LOC 
itself O 
is O 
concerned O 
, O 
it O 
still O 
made O 
some O 
mistakes O 
by O 
itself O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
this O 
itself O 
also O 
failed O 
to O 
meet O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
own O 
demand O 
for O 
economic O 
development O 
and O 
the O 
trend O 
of O 
strengthening O 
economic O 
and O 
trade O 
relations O 
with O 
foreign O 
countries O 
, O 
in O 
particular O 
, O 
the O 
eastern O 
Asian O 
region O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
so O 
as O 
to O 
bring O 
about O 
economic O 
cooperation O 
in O 
this O 
region O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
looking O 
at O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
economy O 
, O 
we O 
should O 
say O 
it O 
is O 
currently O 
recovering O 
its O 
growth O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
externally O 
, O 
it O 
mainly O 
relies O 
on O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
and O 
Chinese O 
markets O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
if O 
the O 
Chinese O 
market O 
suffers O 
from O 
economic O 
cool O 
- O 
down O 
as O 
political O 
coldness O 
takes O 
heat O 
off O 
economic O 
development O 
, O 
it O 
should O 
produce O 
a O 
very O 
negative O 
effect O 
on O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
economy O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
, O 
this O 
year O 
marks O 
the O 
60th O 
anniversary O 
of O 
the O 
founding O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
United I-ORG 
Nations I-ORG 
. O 

Japan B-LOC 
placed O 
its O 
hope O 
of O 
becoming O 
a O 
permanent O 
member O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Security I-ORG 
Council I-ORG 
this O 
year O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
among O 
many O 
reasons O 
that O 
blocked O 
Japan B-LOC 
from O 
getting O 
accepted O 
this O 
year O 
, O 
the O 
most O 
important O 
one O 
was O 
that O 
its O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
did O 
not O 
cast O 
favorable O 
votes O 
. O 

To O 
become O 
a O 
permanent O 
member O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Security I-ORG 
Council I-ORG 
, O 
the O 
most O 
important O 
thing O 
is O 
to O 
first O 
win O 
the O 
support O 
of O 
your O 
own O 
region O 
. O 

Therefore O 
, O 
we O 
should O 
say O 
that O 
it O 
is O 
, O 
right O 
, O 
this O 
Prime O 
Minister O 
Koizumi B-PER 
who O 
has O 
single O 
- O 
handedly O 
ruined O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
dream O 
of O 
becoming O 
a O 
permanent O 
member O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Security I-ORG 
Council I-ORG 
. O 

Some O 
analysts O 
also O 
mentioned O 
this O 
point O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
right O 
now O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
are O 
basically O 
very O 
much O 
disappointed O 
with O 
what O 
Koizumi B-PER 
has O 
been O 
doing O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
many O 
countries O 
have O 
all O 
abandoned O 
their O 
hopes O 
to O 
further O 
mend O 
their O 
relations O 
with O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
actually O 
, O 
right O 
now O 
even O 
the O 
European O 
and O 
US B-LOC 
media O 
have O 
noted O 
this O 
issue O 
. O 

We O 
, O 
including O 
US B-LOC 
President O 
Bush B-PER 
, O 
who O 
came O 
to O 
Pusan B-LOC 
following O 
his O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
this O 
time O 
and O 
then O 
will O 
arrive O 
again O 
in O 
China B-LOC 
, O 
are O 
, O 
in O 
fact O 
, O 
also O 
very O 
concerned O 
with O 
this O 
future O 
development O 
of O 
Sino O 
- O 
Japanese O 
relations O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
because O 
I O 
recently O 
met O 
an O 
American O 
scholar O 
whose O 
first O 
question O 
to O 
me O 
was O 
whether O 
there O 
will O 
be O 
any O 
conflict O 
in O 
the O 
East B-LOC 
China I-LOC 
Sea I-LOC 
region O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
, O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
public O 
and O 
scholars O 
have O 
, O 
started O 
to O 
show O 
concerns O 
over O 
the O 
issue O 
of O 
right O 
and O 
wrong O 
in O 
WW O 
II O 
, O 
the O 
moral O 
issue O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
has O 
started O 
to O 
pay O 
attention O 
to O 
this O 
issue O 
. O 

The O 
US B-LOC 
has O 
kept O 
quiet O 
on O 
the O 
issue O 
of O 
Yasukuni O 
Shrine O 
because O 
it O 
wants O 
to O 
get O 
along O 
with O 
everyone O 
. O 

But O 
now O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
can O 
no O 
longer O 
sit O 
quietly O 
any O 
more O 
. O 

I O 
think O 
that O 
if O 
things O 
go O 
on O 
like O 
this O 
, O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
interests O 
in O 
this O 
region O 
are O 
also O 
going O 
to O 
suffer O 
. O 

This O 
is O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
important O 
indexes O 
that O 
, O 
we O 
should O 
watch O 
for O 
regarding O 
which O 
road O 
exactly O 
Japan B-LOC 
will O 
take O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
, O 
in O 
fact O 
, O 
I O 
now O 
feel O 
that O 
he O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
is O 
somewhat O 
adopting O 
a O 
China B-LOC 
policy O 
that O 
separates O 
politics O 
from O 
economy O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
in O 
politics O 
, O 
he O 
will O 
go O 
against O 
you O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
mainly O 
on O 
the O 
issues O 
of O 
Yasukuni O 
Shrine O 
and O 
textbooks O 
, O 
but O 
in O 
economic O 
and O 
trade O 
affairs O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
he O 
still O 
wants O 
to O 
safeguard O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
economic O 
rights O 
. O 

He O 
is O 
using O 
some O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
people O 
who O 
are O 
, O 
for O 
instance O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
relatively O 
moderate O 
and O 
pragmatic O 
toward O 
China B-LOC 
. O 

, O 
for O 
instance O 
, O 
a O 
politician O 
quite O 
friendly O 
with O 
China B-LOC 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
Toshihiro B-PER 
Nikai I-PER 
, O 
um O 
, O 
was O 
appointed O 
as O 
minister O 
of O 
Economy O 
, O 
Trade O 
and O 
Industry O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
we O 
also O 
see O 
that O 
after O 
Nikai B-PER 
took O 
office O 
, O 
his O 
speech O 
on O 
the O 
Eastern B-LOC 
China I-LOC 
Sea I-LOC 
issue O 
, O 
we O 
should O 
say O 
, O 
is O 
quite O 
appropriate O 
. O 

Ah O 
, O 
in O 
his O 
opinion O 
, O 
he O 
wants O 
to O 
have O 
friendly O 
negotiations O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
with O 
China B-LOC 
if O 
he O 
sees O 
that O 
China B-LOC 
, O 
er O 
, O 
has O 
taken O 
any O 
action O 
. O 

He O 
does O 
not O 
think O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
unilateral O 
action O 
in O 
this O 
disputed O 
area O 
is O 
friendly O 
negotiation O 
. O 

We O 
are O 
certainly O 
willing O 
to O 
watch O 
for O 
this O 
, O 
and O 
will O 
continue O 
to O 
monitor O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

For O 
our O 
final O 
topic O 
, O 
let O 
's O 
go O 
back O 
to O 
the O 
APEC B-ORG 
meeting O 
this O 
time O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
as O 
we O 
mentioned O 
earlier O 
at O 
the O 
beginning O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
a O 
very O 
important O 
purpose O 
for O 
Koizumi B-PER 
to O 
go O 
to O 
attend O 
the O 
APEC B-ORG 
leaders O 
' O 
summit O 
in O 
Pusan B-LOC 
this O 
time O 
is O 
to O 
see O 
if O 
he O 
could O 
try O 
to O 
improve O 
the O 
relations O 
with O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
through O 
talks O 
with O 
President O 
Roh B-PER 
Moo I-PER 
- I-PER 
hyun I-PER 
, O 
as O 
if O 
he O 
were O 
clutching O 
at O 
a O 
life O 
- O 
saving O 
straw O 
. O 

But O 
, O 
could O 
you O 
analyze O 
and O 
predict O 
what O 
kind O 
of O 
achievements O 
he O 
can O 
make O 
during O 
his O 
trip O 
to O 
Pusan B-LOC 
? O 

Well O 
, O 
some O 
people O 
say O 
that O 
as O 
China B-LOC 
's O 
economy O 
is O 
growing O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
is O 
getting O 
somewhat O 
jealous O 
. O 

For O 
instance O 
, O 
China B-LOC 
's O 
economy O 
is O 
growing O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
and O 
getting O 
stronger O 
, O 
but O 
we O 
see O 
the O 
relations O 
between O 
China B-LOC 
and O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
are O 
indeed O 
developing O 
rapidly O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
the O 
current O 
trade O 
between O 
China B-LOC 
and O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
has O 
reached O 
nearly O 
100 O 
billion O 
US O 
dollars O 
. O 

Er O 
, O 
within O 
another O 
period O 
of O 
time O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
by O 
2012 O 
when O 
it O 
is O 
, O 
the O 
20th O 
anniversary O 
of O 
the O 
establishment O 
of O 
diplomatic O 
relations O 
between O 
China B-LOC 
and O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
, O 
200 O 
billion O 
US O 
dollars O 
' O 
worth O 
of O 
economic O 
trade O 
can O 
be O 
reached O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
this O 
will O 
have O 
surpassed O 
what O 
it O 
is O 
now O 
for O 
Japan B-LOC 
and O 
China B-LOC 
which O 
still O 
failed O 
to O 
reach O 
200 O 
billion O 
US O 
dollars O 
at O 
this O 
33rd O 
anniversary O 
of O 
the O 
normalization O 
of O 
their O 
diplomatic O 
relations O 
. O 

We O 
can O 
say O 
, O 
the O 
economic O 
development O 
in O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
and O 
China B-LOC 
, O 
to O 
borrow O 
Roh B-PER 
Moo I-PER 
- I-PER 
hyun I-PER 
's I-PER 
words O 
, O 
is O 
developing O 
rapidly O 
. O 

In O 
addition O 
, O 
we O 
can O 
see O 
that O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
has O 
been O 
improving O 
its O 
relations O 
with O 
all O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
with O 
the O 
exception O 
of O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

China B-LOC 
has O 
also O 
significantly O 
improved O 
its O 
relations O 
with O 
all O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
with O 
the O 
exception O 
of O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

It O 
is O 
the O 
same O 
with O 
Russia B-LOC 
. O 

Er O 
, O 
judging O 
from O 
the O 
situation O 
he O 
is O 
in O 
while O 
participating O 
in O 
the O 
APEC B-ORG 
meeting O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
I O 
am O 
afraid O 
he O 
may O 
not O 
be O 
suffering O 
from O 
friction O 
with O 
neighboring O 
countries O 
only O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
just O 
as O 
we O 
mentioned O 
at O 
the O 
start O 
of O 
the O 
program O 
, O 
during O 
his O 
trip O 
to O 
Pusan B-LOC 
, O 
Koizumi B-PER 
must O 
feel O 
not O 
only O 
isolated O 
but O 
also O 
surely O 
frustrated O 
. O 

All O 
right O 
, O 
dear O

, O 
that O 
's O 
all O 
for O

Over O 
the O

the O

After O

It O 
can O

that O

an O

that O

Let O 
me O 
briefly O 
introduce O

one O 
is O 
Mr. O 
Jin B-PER 
Xide I-PER

an O

Mr. O

an O

on O

issues O 
from O 
the B-ORG

Sciences I-ORG 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
at O 
the O 
beginning O 
of O 
the O 
program O 
, O 
let O 
's O 
learn O 
about O 
the O 
situation O 
in O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

Let O 
's O 
now O 
connect O 
via O 
telephone O 
with O 
Mr. O 
Wang B-PER 
Xinsheng I-PER 
, O 
an O 
expert O 
on O 
Japanese O 
issues O 
from O 
Beijing B-ORG 
University I-ORG 
who O 
is O 
currently O 
visiting O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

However O 
, O 
the O 
general O 
reaction O 
from O 
scholars O 
, O 
media O 
, O 
or O 
ordinary O 
people O 
here O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
is O 
rather O 
low O 
key O 
, O 
because O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
there O 
has O 
been O 
no O 
progress O 
on O 
the O 
two O 
issues O 
that O 
Japan B-LOC 
is O 
relatively O 
concerned O 
with O 
, O 
the O 
Northern B-LOC 
Territories I-LOC 
issue O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
oil O 
pipeline O 
route O 
issue O 
. O 

Regarding O 
the O 
Northern B-LOC 
Territories I-LOC 
issue O 
, O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
President O 
Putin B-PER 
purposely O 
avoided O 
this O 
issue O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
he O 
did O 
not O 
really O 
want O 
to O 
talk O 
about O 
it O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
on O 
the O 
oil O 
pipeline O 
route O 
issue O 
, O 
though O 
the O 
Russian O 
side O 
promised O 
to O 
connect O 
it O 
with O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
there O 
was O 
no O 
talk O 
about O 
prioritizing O 
a O 
connection O 
with O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

The O 
media O 
here O 
is O 
concerned O 
because O 
Russia B-LOC 
already O 
promised O 
to O 
prioritize O 
connecting O 
it O 
with O 
China B-LOC 
, O 
er O 
, O 
, O 
so O 
the O 
media O 
here O 
is O 
concerned O 
that O 
it O 
is O 
an O 
empty O 
promise O 
. O 

In O 
this O 
way O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
may O 
not O 
get O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
any O 
material O 
benefit O 
, O 
while O 
the O 
Russian O 
side O 
will O 
have O 
gained O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
support O 
for O 
its O 
WTO B-ORG 
accession O 
. O 

Er O 
, O 
in O 
addition O 
, O 
at O 
the O

Federation I-ORG

, O 
Russian O 
President O 
Putin B-PER 
urged O 
the O 
Japanese O 
business O 
community O 
to O 
invest O 
in O 
Russia B-LOC 
. O 

However O 
, O 
due O 
to O 
the O 
territorial O 
issues O 
, O 
or O 
little O 
progress O 
on O 
the O 
territorial O

, O 
along O

the O

concerns O 
with O 
the O

in O

, O 
well O 
, O 
it O 
remains O 
a O 
big O 
question O 
how O 
far O

cooperation O 
can O 
go O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
what O 
kind O 
of O 
response O 
did O

in O

have O

well O 
, O 
some O 
of O 
the O

has O 
made O 
? O 

, O 
that O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
we O 
also O 
saw O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
in O 
Tokyo B-LOC 
, O 
some O 
right O

signed O 
12 O 
agreements O 
, O 
it O 
seems O 
that O 
Japan B-LOC 
is O 
not O 
very O 
satisfied O 
with O 
the O 
content O 
of O 
the O 
agreements O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
the O 
content O 
, O 
because O 
it O 
seems O 
that O 
neither O 
of O 
the O 
two O 
issues O 
that O 
Japan B-LOC 
wanted O 
greatly O 
to O 
talk O 
about O 
, O 
the O 
four O 
northern O 
islands O 
issue O 
and O 
the O 
oil O 
pipeline O 
issue O 
, O 
made O 
the O 
achievements O 
they O 
had O 
anticipated O 
. O 

As O 
we O 
know O 
, O 
Putin B-LOC 
has O 
kept O 
putting O 
off O 
this O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
since O 
last O 
year O 
, O 
like O 
back O 
then O 
when O 
Yeltsin B-PER 
repeatedly O 
postponed O 
his O 
trip O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

That O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
asked O 
for O 
too O 
high O 
a O 
price O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
, O 
it O 
asked O 
the O 
Russian O 
president O 
to O 
come O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
to O 
make O 
concessions O 
on O 
territorial O 
issues O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
attitude O 
was O 
that O 
it O 
would O 
not O 
talk O 
about O 
territorial O 
issues O 
if O 
it O 
went O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
, O 
from O 
the O 
perspective O 
of O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
without O 
discussion O 
of O 
territorial O 
issues O 
, O 
the O 
talks O 
were O 
viewed O 
as O 
making O 
no O 
progress O 
. O 

What O 
method O 
does O 
he O 
want O 
to O 
use O 
to O 
remedy O 
the O 
lethargic O 
post-APEC B-ORG 
diplomatic O 
situation O 
? O 

Well O 
, O 
what O 
Russia B-LOC 
actually O 
wants O 
is O 
economic O 
cooperation O 
with O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 

including O 
the O 
development O 
of O 
oil O 
resources O 
in O 
eastern O 
Siberia B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
some O 
other O 
investment O 
and O 
trade O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
is O 
still O 
like O 
this O 
, O 
saying O 
first O 
return O 
the O 
territories O 
, O 
then O 
we O 
can O 
talk O 
about O 
economics O 
. O 

Er O 
, O 
Director O 
Xing B-PER 
, O 
it O 
can O 
be O 
said O 
that O 
this O 
time O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
very O 
important O 
purposes O 
of O 
President O 
Putin B-PER 
's O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
is O 
to O 
facilitate O 
the O 
progress O 
of O 
bilateral O 
relations O 
through O 
economic O 
development O 
. O 

The O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
was O 
in O 
itself O 
one O 
of O 
Putin B-PER 
's O 
important O 
aims O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
, O 
how O 
did O 
he O 
come O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
? O 

As O 
mentioned O 
earlier O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
it O 
had O 
been O 
postponed O 
again O 
and O 
again O 
, O 
but O 
by O 
way O 
of O 
this O 
kind O 
of O 
opportunity O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
Putin B-PER 
's O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
was O 
smoothly O 
accomplished O 
. O 

It O 
was O 
that O 
Russia B-LOC 
sent O 
a O 
very O 
important O 
message O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
Russia B-LOC 
is O 
willing O 
to O 
develop O 
relations O 
with O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
in O 
fact O 
the O 
theory O 
of O 
joint O 
development O 
was O 
originally O 
proposed O 
by O 
Russia B-LOC 
. O 

It O 
had O 
been O 
raised O 
prior O 
to O 
that O 
too O 
, O 
but O 
Japan B-LOC 
did O 
not O 
accept O 
it O 
at O 
that O 
time O 
. O 

Japan B-LOC 
's O 
recent O 
reaction O 
is O 
not O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
mainstream O 
domestic O 
opinion O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
domestic O 
political O 
circles O 
in O 
Japan B-LOC 
all O 
opposed O 
this O 
suggestion O 
by O 
Taro B-PER 
Aso I-PER 
. O 

They O 
said O 
that O 
with O 
joint O 
development O 
, O 
Russia B-LOC 
would O 
advocate O 
adopting O 
the O 
current O 
Russian O 
controlled O 
situation O 
, O 
the O 
current O 
situation O 
, O 
and O 
applying O 
Russian O 
law O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
by O 
making O 
investments O 
there O 
, O 
in O 
fact O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
it O 
would O 
be O 
equivalent O 
to O 
permanent O 
recognition O 
that O 
the O 
four O 
islands O 
are O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
. O 

Regarding O 
the O 
joint O 
development O 
he O 
talked O 
about O 
, O 
Russia B-LOC 
is O 
also O 
very O 
interesting B-LOC 
. O 

, O 
the O 
Japanese O 
proposed O 
it O 
, O 
now O 
Russia B-LOC 
instead O 
rejected O 
it O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
this O 
also O 
has O 
a O 
lot O 
to O 
do O 
with O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
strategy O 
of O 
building O 
a O 
powerful O 
nation O 
. O 

Russia B-LOC 
now O 
, O 
it O 
has O 
independently O 
formulated O 
a O 
strategic O 
vision O 
of O 
developing O 
the O 
Far B-LOC 
East I-LOC 
and O 
Siberian O 
regions O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
before O 
this O 
, O 
we O 
have O 
one O 
more O 
question O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
regarding O 
the O 
issue O 
of O 
this O 
Russian O 
President O 
Putin B-LOC 
's O 
repeated O 
postponement O 
of O 
his O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 

Why O 
did O 
Russian O 
President O 
Putin B-PER 
visit O 
Japan B-LOC 
again O 
after O 
, O 
an O 
interval O 
of O 
five O 
years O 
, O 
after O 
quite O 
a O 
few O 
twists O 
and O 
turns O 
? O 

It O 
can O 
be O 
said O 
that O 
Putin B-PER 
's O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
after O 
an O 
interval O 
of O 
five O 
years O 
was O 
realized O 
following O 
quite O 
a O 
few O 
twists O 
and O 
turns O 
. O 

The O 
Japanese O 
side O 
hoped O 
that O 
after O 
winning O 
the O 
presidential O 
election O 
in O 
March O 
of O 
that O 
year O 
, O 
Putin B-PER 
could O 
personally O 
intervene O 
in O 
the O 
territorial O 
issues O 
existing O 
between O 
Japan B-LOC 
and O 
Russia B-LOC 
for O 
a O 
long O 
time O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
by O 
May O 
, O 
the O 
Russian O 
side O 
said O 
it O 
could O 
not O 
provide O 
measures O 
for O 
resolving O 
the O 
territorial O 
issues O 
, O 
and O 
Putin B-PER 
's O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
was O 
pushed O 
to O 
the O 
spring O 
of O 
2005 O 
. O 

While O 
Japan B-LOC 
expressed O 
helplessness O 
to O 
this O 
, O 
it O 
hoped O 
Putin B-PER 
could O 
visit O 
in O 
February O 
as O 
it O 
was O 
the O 
150th O 
anniversary O 
of O 
the O 
signing O 
of O 
a O 
trade O 
and O 
border O 
treaty O 
between O 
Japan B-LOC 
and O 
Russia B-LOC 
. O 

However O 
, O 
Putin B-PER 
responded O 
only O 
with O 
a O 
congratulatory O 
telegram O 
, O 
with O 
no O 
mention O 
of O 
his O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

This O 
move O 
at O 
once O 
infuriated O 
Russia B-LOC 
. O 

Accordingly O 
, O 
the O 
date O 
of O 
Putin B-PER 
's O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
turned O 
into O 
a O 
variable O 
which O 
nobody O 
could O 
explain O 
. O 

In O 
various O 
versions O 
, O 
some O 
said O 
Putin B-PER 
would O 
visit O 
Japan B-LOC 
in O 
April O 
2005 O 
, O 
some O 
said O 
May O 
, O 
while O 
others O 
said O 
June O 
. O 

In O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
diplomatic O 
circles O 
, O 
there O 
were O 
even O 
widespread O 
rumors O 
, O 
including O 
that O 
Putin B-PER 
would O 
not O 
visit O 
Japan B-LOC 
within O 
the O 
year O 
and O 
that O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
ambassador O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
would O 
soon O 
be O 
removed O 
. O 

Furthermore O 
, O 
precisely O 
because O 
of O 
this O 
, O 
Putin B-PER 
's O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
was O 
basically O 
confirmed O 
. O 

This O 
time O 
, O 
on O 
this O 
visit O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
between O 
Russia B-LOC 
and O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
as O 
far O 
as O 
Japan B-LOC 
was O 
concerned O 
, O 
it O 
really O 
hoped O 
that O 
Russian O 
President O 
Putin B-PER 
would O 
talk O 
about O 
the O 
four O 
northern O 
islands O 
issue O 
during O 
his O 
visit O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
thinking O 
was O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
we O 
want O 
to O 
develop O 
the O 
economy O 
first O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
was O 
this O 
also O 
the O 
reason O 
that O 
caused O 
Russian O 
President O 
Putin B-PER 
, O 
in O 
spite O 
of O 
" O 
the O 
two O 
being O 
close O 
neighbors O 
" O 
these O 
five O 
years O 
, O 
to O 
visit O 
Japan B-LOC 
again O 
only O 
after O 
, O 
an O 
interval O 
of O 
five O 
years O 
? O 

That O 
is O 
, O 
Gorbachev B-PER 
recognized O 
the O 
four O 
islands O 
issue O 
between O 
Japan B-LOC 
and O 
Russia B-LOC 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
there O 
was O 
once O 
an O 
opportunity O 
for O 
this O 
, O 
but O 
Japan B-LOC 
again O 
did O 
not O 
seize O 
it O 
. O 

Russia B-LOC 
has O 
changed O 
a O 
lot O 
as O 
well O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
when O 
it O 
came O 
to O 
the O 
critical O 
moment O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
on O 
the O 
territorial O 
issues O 
, O 
perhaps O 
due O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
domestic O 
nationalist O 
sentiments O 
and O 
the O 
sensitivity O 
of O 
the O 
territorial O 
issues O 
, O 
it O 
was O 
impossible O 
for O 
any O 
prime O 
minister O 
to O 
claim O 
for O 
two O 
islands O 
only O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
, O 
it O 
was O 
impossible O 
to O 
give O 
the O 
territories O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

Eh O 
, O 
we O 
all O 
know O 
Japan B-LOC 
is O 
the O 
second O 
largest O 
economy O 
in O 
the O 
world O 
. O 

Furthermore O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
is O 
also O 
a O 
very O 
important O 
investor O 
overseas O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
a O 
set O 
of O 
data O 
shows O 
that O 
Japanese O 
investment O 
in O 
Russia B-LOC 
accounts O 
for O 
only O 
1 O 
% O 
of O 
its O 
investments O 
overseas O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
just O 
over O 
700 O 
million O 
US O 
dollars O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
as O 
Russia B-LOC 
should O 
be O 
said O 
to O 
badly O 
need O 
Japanese O 
funds O 
, O 
as O 
well O 
as O 
badly O 
needing O 
Japanese O 
economic O 
cooperation O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
how O 
urgent O 
do O 
you O 
think O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
need O 
is O 
? O 

I O 
think O 
the O 
time O 
of O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
most O 
urgent O 
need O 
is O 
already O 
over O 
. O 

At O 
that O 
time O 
, O 
Russia B-LOC 
was O 
indeed O 
pressing O 
for O 
Japanese O 
investment O 
. O 

Because O 
Russia B-LOC 
was O 
in O 
a O 
deep O 
degree O 
of O 
overall O 
crisis O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
now O 
, O 
the O 
economic O 
crisis O 
in O 
Russia B-LOC 
is O 
essentially O 
over O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
under O 
such O 
circumstances O 
, O 
Russia B-LOC 
, O 
er O 
, O 
it O 
can O 
make O 
diplomatic O 
arrangements O 
calmly O 
. O 

Therefore O 
, O 
I O 
think O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
again O 
lost O 
the O 
best O 
opportunity O 
to O 
enter O 
the O 
Russian O 
market O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
at O 
that O 
time O 
if O 
Japan B-LOC 
had O 
made O 
a O 
very O 
good O 
investment O 
in O 
Russia B-LOC 
, O 
well O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
economy O 
, O 
it O 
could O 
have O 
helped O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
economic O 
recovery O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
currently O 
Japan B-LOC 
is O 
very O 
important O 
to O 
Russia B-LOC 
again O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
as O 
a O 
neighboring O 
nation O 
, O 
especially O 
as O 
Japan B-LOC 
is O 
a O 
world O 
economic O 
power O 
, O 
Russia B-LOC 
really O 
needs O 
Japanese O 
investment O 
, O 
now O 
not O 
Japanese O 
aid O 
, O 
but O 
its O 
investment O 
. O 

He O 
used O 
an O 
expression O 
, O 
saying O 
that O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
diplomacy O 
is O 
economic O 
diplomacy O 
. O 

All O 
, O 
diplomatic O 
activities O 
must O 
promote O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
prosperity O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
development O 
, O 
and O 
wealth O 
and O 
power O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
seen O 
from O 
this O 
perspective O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
is O 
very O 
important O 
to O 
Russia B-LOC 
. O 

Therefore O 
, O 
just O 
now O 
you O 
mentioned O 
some O 
figures O 
regarding O 
Russian O 
- O 
Japanese O 
relations O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
economic O 
and O 
trade O 
relations O 
, O 
for O 
such O 
a O 
large O 
, O 
such O 
a O 
powerful O 
economy O 
as O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
well O 
, O 
it O 
invested O 
only O 
700-plus O 
million O 
in O 
Russia B-LOC 
. O 

It O 
has O 
nearly O 
reached O 
200 O 
billion O 
between O 
China B-LOC 
and O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

er O 
, O 
between O 
Russia B-LOC 
and O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
the O 
trade O 
volume O 
only O 
equals O 
, O 
of O 
Sino O 
- O 
Japanese O 
trade O 
volume O 
, O 
one O 
twenty O 
- O 
second O 
. O 

I O 
will O 
explain O 
two O 
issues O 
-- O 
one O 
, O 
it O 
may O 
show O 
that O 
the O 
economic O 
environment O 
in O 
Russia B-LOC 
is O 
indeed O 
not O 
very O 
good O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
not O 
that O 
Japan B-LOC 
does O 
not O 
need O 
the O 
Russian O 
market O 
. O 

Putin B-PER 
came O 
this O 
time O 
bringing O 
more O 
than O 
100 O 
people O 
, O 
such O 
a O 
large O 
delegation O 
, O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

I O 
think O 
that O 
with O 
regard O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
relations O 
with O 
Russia B-LOC 
, O 
it O 
has O 
been O 
like O 
this O 
since O 
the O 
1970s O 
. O 

I O 
will O 
invest O 
, O 
I O 
will O 
give O 
you O 
aid O 
to O 
develop O 
eastern O 
Siberia B-LOC 
. O 

That O 
's O 
because O 
Russia B-LOC 
has O 
a O 
vast O 
area O 
of O 
land O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
used O 
economics O 
for O 
political O 
purposes O 
. O 

In O 
fact O 
, O 
regarding O 
Putin B-PER 
's O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
this O 
time O 
, O 
the O 
media O 
earlier O 
predicted O 
, O 
among O 
other O 
things O 
, O 
that O 
when O 
the O 
time O 
came O 
, O 
there O 
would O 
be O 
more O 
than O 
60 O 
groups O 
totaling O 
more O 
than O 
700 O 
people O 
, O 
along O 
with O 
, O 
hey O 
, O 
more O 
than O 
200 O 
propaganda O 
trucks O 
on O 
the O 
streets O 
of O 
downtown O 
Tokyo B-LOC 
, O 
to O 
protest O 
against O 
Putin B-PER 
's O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

And O 
what O 
impact O 
will O 
it O 
have O 
on O 
Putin B-PER 
's O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
? O 

But O 
, O 
with O 
regard O 
to O 
this O 
Russian O 
issue O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
this O 
can O 
not O 
be O 
simply O 
regarded O 
as O 
a O 
handful O 
of O 
people O 
making O 
trouble O 
, O 
because O 
there O 
are O 
widespread O 
historical O 
grievances O 
among O 
ordinary O 
people O 
in O 
Japan B-LOC 
against O 
Russia B-LOC 
. O 

That O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
this O 
involves O 
the O 
origin O 
of O 
the O 
Northern B-LOC 
Territories I-LOC 
issue O 
. O 

In O 
fact O 
, O 
ownership O 
of O 
the B-LOC 
Northern I-LOC 
Territories I-LOC 
has O 
changed O 
several O 
times O 
, O 
and O 
there O 
has O 
been O 
no O 
single O 
law O 
. O 

Now O 
Russia B-LOC 
says O 
this O 
was O 
the O 
result O 
of O 
WWII O 
international O 
laws O 
and O 
treaties O 
, O 
with O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
also O 
recognizing O 
it O 
at O 
that O 
time O 
. O 

The O 
entire O 
international O 
community O 
recognizes O 
that O 
the O 
four O 
islands O 
should O 
belong O 
to O 
Russia B-LOC 
. O 

Both O 
the O 
Yalta O 
Agreement O 
and O 
Article O 
2 O 
of O 
the O 
San O 
Francisco O 
Treaty O 
recognize O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
relinquishment O 
of O 
the B-LOC 
Kuril I-LOC 
Islands I-LOC 
. O 

However O 
, O 
then O 
there O 
is O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
nationalist O 
sentiment O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
believes O 
that O 
the B-LOC 
Soviet I-LOC 
Union I-LOC 
unilaterally O 
broke O 
the O 
Pact O 
of O 
Neutrality O 
, O 
sending O 
troops O 
into O 
Northeast B-LOC 
China I-LOC 
and O 
defeating O 
the B-ORG 
Kwantung I-ORG 
Army I-ORG 
. O 

For O 
things O 
like O 
this O 
, O 
as O 
Japan B-LOC 
looks O 
at O 
this O 
piece O 
of O 
history O 
-- O 
also O 
, O 
Japanese O 
captives O 
were O 
dragged O 
to O 
Siberia B-LOC 
to O 
labor O 
camps O 
-- O 
I O 
heard O 
there O 
were O 
100,000 O 
, O 
200,000 O 
. O 

Therefore O 
, O 
unraveling O 
this O 
historical O 
feud O 
, O 
the O 
Northern B-LOC 
Territories I-LOC 
issue O 
, O 
is O 
not O 
so O 
clear O 
- O 
cut O 
, O 
since O 
history O 
, O 
society O 
, O 
and O 
law O 
, O 
as O 
well O 
as O 
nationalist O 
sentiments O 
are O 
all O 
entangled O 
together O 
. O 

The O 
four O 
islands O 
, O 
Iturup B-LOC 
, O 
Shikotan B-LOC 
, O 
the B-LOC 
Khabomai I-LOC 
Rocks I-LOC 
, O 
and O 
Kunashir B-LOC 
, O 
are O 
located O 
in O 
the O 
northern O 
part O 
of O 
the O 
western O 
Pacific B-LOC 
Ocean I-LOC 
, O 
with O 
a O 
total O 
area O 
of O 
about O 
5,000 O 
square O 
kilometers O 
, O 
which O 
Japan B-LOC 
calls O 
the O 
four O 
northern O 
islands O 
, O 
and O 
Russia B-LOC 
calls O 
Southern B-LOC 
Chishima I-LOC 
. O 

In O 
August O 
1945 O 
, O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
dropped O 
atomic O 
bombs O 
on O 
Hiroshima B-LOC 
and O 
Nagasaki B-LOC 
in O 
succession O 
. O 

To O 
ask O 
the B-LOC 
Soviet I-LOC 
Union I-LOC 
to O 
declare O 
war O 
against O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
and O 
Britain B-LOC 
gave O 
Russia B-LOC 
the O 
Chishima B-LOC 
Islands I-LOC 
and O 
the O 
southern O 
part O 
of O 
Sakhalin B-LOC 
Island I-LOC 
, O 
which O 
Japan B-LOC 
occupied O 
at O 
the O 
time O 
. O 

In O 
1955 O 
the B-LOC 
Soviet I-LOC 
Union I-LOC 
and O 
Japan B-LOC 
began O 
negotiations O 
regarding O 
the O 
normalization O 
of O 
relations O 
. O 

The O 
then O 
Soviet B-LOC 
Union I-LOC 
indicated O 
willingness O 
to O 
return O 
the B-LOC 
Khabomai I-LOC 
Rocks I-LOC 
and O 
Shikotan B-LOC 
. O 

Yet O 
Japan B-LOC 
requested O 
that O 
the B-LOC 
Soviet I-LOC 
Union I-LOC 
return O 
Iturup B-LOC 
and O 
Kunashiri B-LOC 
as O 
well O 
. O 

It O 
also O 
requested O 
that O 
the B-LOC 
Soviet I-LOC 
Union I-LOC 
promise O 
to O 
attend O 
the O 
international O 
peace O 
conference O 
to O 
determine O 
the O 
ownership O 
of O 
Sakhalin B-LOC 
and O 
the O 
entire O 
Chishima B-LOC 
Islands I-LOC 
. O 

In O 
1956 O 
, O 
the O 
then O 
Soviet B-LOC 
Union I-LOC 
restated O 
its O 
willingness O 
to O 
return O 
the B-LOC 
Khabomai I-LOC 
Rocks I-LOC 
and O 
Shikotan B-LOC 
. O 

Japan B-LOC 
again O 
said O 
that O 
unless O 
the O 
four O 
islands O 
were O 
returned O 
together O 
, O 
the O 
Soviet O 
proposal O 
could O 
definitely O 
not O 
be O 
accepted O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
we O 
noticed O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
just O 
now O 
this O 
short O 
clip O 
also O 
talked O 
about O 
it O 
, O 
at O 
that O 
time O 
the B-LOC 
Soviet I-LOC 
Union I-LOC 
agreed O 
to O 
return O 
two O 
islands O 
first O 
, O 
, O 
but O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
Japan B-LOC 
never O 
agreed O 
. O 

But O 
now O 
, O 
we O 
also O 
notice O 
that O 
, O 
Taro B-PER 
Aso I-PER 
proposed O 
a O 
new O 
idea O 
, O 
the O 
joint O 
development O 
that O 
the B-LOC 
Soviet I-LOC 
Union I-LOC 
had O 
previously O 
talked O 
about O 
. O 

Oh O 
, O 
as O 
I O 
just O 
mentioned O 
, O 
it O 
was O 
against O 
a O 
large O 
background O 
that O 
Russia B-LOC 
first O 
proposed O 
it O 
. O 

With O 
, O 
quite O 
a O 
troubled O 
economy O 
, O 
Russia B-LOC 
needed O 
Japanese O 
investment O 
, O 
needed O 
Japan B-LOC 
to O 
get O 
involved O 
through O 
this O 
channel O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
now O 
that O 
its O 
economy O 
has O 
greatly O 
improved O 
, O 
Russia B-LOC 
does O 
not O 
need O 
to O 
take O 
this O 
diplomatic O 
risk O 
. O 

Second O 
, O 
Russia B-LOC 
should O 
be O 
seen O 
as O 
a O 
rather O 
strong O 
nation O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
Putin B-PER 
's O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
this O 
time O 
, O 
or O 
during O 
his O 
visit O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
or O 
prior O 
to O 
this O 
, O 
there O 
were O 
rallies O 
in O 
the O 
Far B-LOC 
East I-LOC 
region O 
, O 
including O 
the O 
Sakhalin B-LOC 
area O 
, O 
meant O 
to O 
give O 
many O 
warnings O 
to O 
Putin B-PER 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
one O 
Russian O 
politician O 
stated O 
very O 
clearly O 
that O 
while O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
territory O 
is O 
vast O 
, O 
Russia B-LOC 
does O 
not O 
have O 
territories O 
to O 
spare O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
, O 
does O 
n't O 
Russia B-LOC 
advocate O 
a O 
double O 
- O 
headed O 
eagle O 
policy O 
? O 

Well O 
, O 
if O 
he O 
wants O 
development O 
in O 
Asia B-LOC 
, O 
wo O 
n't O 
he O 
close O 
the O 
door O 
if O 
he O 
loses O 
hold O 
of O 
the O 
four O 
northern O 
islands O 
now O 
? O 

The O 
four O 
northern O 
islands O 
not O 
only O 
have O 
mineral O 
deposits O 
, O 
oil O 
, O 
and O 
fisheries O 
, O 
but O 
also O 
for O 
military O 
strategy O 
, O 
they O 
are O 
key O 
positions O 
in O 
the B-LOC 
Pacific I-LOC 
Ocean I-LOC 
. O 

In O 
the B-LOC 
Pacific I-LOC 
Ocean I-LOC 
, O 
right O 
. O 

Currently O 
Russia B-LOC 
seems O 
to O 
be O 
in O 
a O 
period O 
of O 
low O 
tide O 
, O 
but O 
it O 
wo O 
n't O 
stay O 
this O 
way O 
forever O 
. O 

It O 
would O 
benefit O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

Russia B-LOC 
has O 
foreseen O 
the O 
consequences O 
. O 

That O 
's O 
why O 
Russia B-LOC 
now O 
rejects O 
it O 
. O 

It O 
was O 
originally O 
proposed O 
by O 
Russia B-LOC 
, O 
but O 
rejected O 
by O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

That O 
is O 
, O 
Russian O 
- O 
Japanese O 
relations O 
, O 
from O 
the O 
perspective O 
of O 
Russia B-LOC 
, O 
I O 
do O 
n't O 
see O 
many O 
changes O 
in O 
the O 
large O 
framework O 
of O 
Russian O 
- O 
Japanese O 
relations O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
current O 
signs O 
show O 
that O 
Russia B-LOC 
and O 
Japan B-LOC 
are O 
moving O 
forward O 
on O 
economic O 
issues O 
, O 
on O 
economic O 
cooperation O 
. O 

One O 
example O 
is O 
that O 
this O 
year O 
Toyota B-ORG 
Motor I-ORG 
has O 
invested O 
in O 
St. B-LOC 
Petersburg I-LOC 
. O 

That O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
-- O 
Japan B-LOC 
has O 
now O 
invested O 
in O 
Russia B-LOC 
. O 

Second O 
, O 
what O 
Japan B-LOC 
hopes O 
to O 
get O 
is O 
, O 
hey O 
, O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
oil O 
. O 

Though O 
Russia B-LOC 
did O 
not O 
make O 
a O 
final O 
commitment O 
, O 
there O 
is O 
already O 
a O 
general O 
framework O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
eventually O 
Russia B-LOC 
's O 
oil O 
pipeline O 
will O 
be O 
connected O 
to O 
a O 
Pacific B-LOC 
Ocean I-LOC 
port O 
, O 
which O 
will O 
benefit O 
Japan B-LOC 
. O 

Okay O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
today O 
we O 
will O 
end O 
our O 
discussion O

on O 
the O

to O 
look O 
at O 
the O 
reaction O 
of O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

What O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
is O 
now O 
asking O 
Britain B-LOC 
to O 
do O 
is O 
to O 
either O 
confirm O 
the O 
news O 
as O 
true O 
or O 
to O 
deny O 
it O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
right O 
now O 
, O 
Britain B-LOC 
has O 
neither O 
said O 
it O 
is O 
true O 
nor O 
said O 
it O 
is O 
not O 
. O 

One O 
is O 
whether O 
there O 
is O 
any O 
secret O 
being O 
divulged O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
other O 
is O 
whether O 
the O 
news O 
that O 
Bush B-PER 
wanted O 
to O 
bomb O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
is O 
true O 
. O 

Eh O 
, O 
in O 
other O 
words O 
, O 
although O 
they O 
were O 
interrogated O 
, O 
whether O 
the O 
secret O 
leaked O 
was O 
something O 
like O 
our O 
topic O 
today O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
Bush B-PER 
said O 
he O 
wanted O 
to O 
bomb O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
, O 
whether O 
the O 
secret O 
divulged O 
was O 
this O 
record O 
, O 
these O 
are O 
still O 
two O 
different O 
things O 
. O 

On O 
April O 
16 O 
of O 
last O 
year O 
when O 
Blair B-PER 
was O 
visiting O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
, O 
they O 
had O 
some O 
exchange O 
between O 
them O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
in O 
this O 
memo O 
, O 
Bush B-PER 
seemed O 
to O 
imply O 
that O 
he O 
probably O 
wanted O 
to O 
bomb O 
this O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
but O 
the O 
very O 
authenticity O 
of O 
the O 
incident O 
, O 
I O 
think O 
, O 
still O 
needs O 
to O 
be O 
determined O 
by O 
the O 
British O 
government O 
or O 
US B-LOC 
government O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
Mr. O 
Wu B-PER 
, O 
we O 
know O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
you O 
worked O 
as O 
a O 
reporter O 
in O 
Qatar B-LOC 
and O 
were O 
very O 
familiar O 
with O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

I O 
think O 
it O 
is O 
possible O 
that O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
wanted O 
to O 
bomb O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

That O 
's O 
because O 
all O 
the O 
things O 
reported O 
by O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
since O 
its O 
establishment O 
in O 
1996 O 
were O 
those O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
did O 
not O 
want O 
viewers O 
in O 
the O 
world O 
to O 
look O 
at O 
, O 
especially O 
with O 
respect O 
to O 
the O 
Afghan O 
war O 
and O 
Iraq O 
war O 
. O 

What O 
they O 
reported O 
was O 
entirely O 
incompatible O 
with O 
the O 
so O 
- O 
called O 
freedom O 
of O 
the O 
press O 
advocated O 
by O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
. O 

For O 
instance O 
, O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
attacked O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
several O 
times O 
. O 

It O 
happened O 
once O 
that O 
when O 
Bush B-PER 
, O 
er O 
, O 
together O 
with O 
that O 
Defense O 
Secretary O 
Rumsfeld B-PER 
visited O 
Qatar B-LOC 
, O 
they O 
, O 
put O 
pressure O 
on O 
the O 
Qatari O 
government O 
, O 
saying O 
you O 
should O 
not O 
broadcast O 
these O 
news O 
items O 
that O 
were O 
harmful O 
to O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
later O 
, O 
under O 
such O 
circumstances O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
the O 
director O 
of O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
was O 
replaced O 
once O 
. O 

But O 
, O 
the O 
leader O 
of O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
, O 
Jazeera B-ORG 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
Qatar B-LOC 
replied O 
that O 
we O 
advocate O 
the O 
same O 
freedom O 
of O 
the O 
press O 
as O 
the O 
freedom O 
of O 
the O 
press O 
in O 
your O 
country O 
and O 
that O 
our O 
government O 
has O 
no O 
right O 
to O 
interfere O 
with O 
what O 
is O 
being O 
reported O 
by O 
a O 
private O 
TV O 
station O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
according O 
to O 
your O 
judgment O 
, O 
this O 
incident O 
was O 
possible O 
because O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
has O 
long O 
considered O 
it O 
a O 
thorn O 
in O 
its O 
flesh O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
to O 
say O 
that O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
government O 
or O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
president O 
had O 
such O 
an O 
idea O 
, O 
you O 
think O 
many O 
people O 
may O 
easily O 
believe O 
it O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
let O 
's O 
now O 
focus O 
on O 
this O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

As O 
a O 
matter O 
of O 
fact O 
, O 
when O 
we O 
watch O 
TV O 
, O 
we O 
can O 
see O 
many O 
news O 
services O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
including O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
CNN B-ORG 
and O 
the O 
British O 
BBC B-ORG 
, O 
often O 
replaying O 
footage O 
by O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG

TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

Since O 
the O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
logo O 
is O 
on O 
, O 
people O 
should O 
be O 
quite O 
familiar O 
with O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

But O 
how O 
did O 
this O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
rise O 
to O 
fame O 
competing O 
with O 
so O 
many O 
Western O 
media O 
outlets O 
in O 
news O 
coverage O 
? O 

Al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
, O 
established O 
in O 
November O 
1996 O 
in O 
Qatar B-LOC 
, O 
is O 
an O 
Arabic O 
- O 
language O 
news O 
TV O 
station O 
broadcasting O 
global O 
news O 
and O 
reports O 
nonstop O 
around O 
the O 
clock O 
. O 

In O 
September O 
2001 O 
, O 
the O 
9 O 
/ O 
11 O 
attacks O 
broke O 
out O 
in O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
. O 

On O 
October O 
7 O 
, O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
and O 
Britain B-LOC 
launched O 
military O 
strikes O 
on O 
the O 
Taliban B-ORG 
in O 
Afghanistan B-LOC 
. O 

When O 
people O 
all O 
over O 
the O 
world O 
expected O 
to O 
watch O 
the O 
live O 
broadcast O 
of O 
the O 
war O 
by O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
CNN B-ORG 
, O 
they O 
could O 
only O 
see O 
a O 
few O 
blurry O 
images O 
on O 
TV O 
. O 

Meanwhile O 
, O 
however O 
, O 
the O 
little O 
known O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
based O 
in O 
the O 
small O 
Gulf B-LOC 
country O 
of O 
Qatar B-LOC 
suddenly O 
emerged O 
to O 
broadcast O 
the O 
progress O 
of O 
the O 
Afghan O 
war O 
in O 
Arabic O 
language O 
and O 
mobilized O 
its O 
27 O 
reporting O 
stations O 
all O 
over O 
the O 
world O 
to O 
conduct O 
an O 
around O 
- O 
the O 
- O 
clock O 
follow O 
up O 
coverage O 
. O 

When O 
the O 
Taliban B-ORG 
regime O 
announced O 
that O 
reporters O 
from O 
all O 
countries O 
were O 
banned O 
from O 
entering O 
the O 
territory O 
of O 
Afghanistan B-LOC 
, O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
was O 
the O 
only O 
one O 
that O 
could O 
enter O 
the O 
Taliban B-ORG 
- O 
controlled O 
area O 
. O 

Taking O 
such O 
an O 
advantage O 
, O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
started O 
to O 
establish O 
its O 
unique O 
leading O 
position O 
in O 
covering O 
the O 
Afghan O 
war O 
with O 
its O 
frequent O 
live O 
broadcast O 
of O 
missile O 
attacks O 
on O 
the O 
Afghan O 
capital O 
of O 
Kabul B-LOC 
. O 

During O 
the O 
war O 
, O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
continued O 
to O 
broadcast O 
exclusive O 
news O 
and O 
images O 
under O 
its O 
logo O 
and O 
sell O 
them O 
to O 
competitors O 
at O 
the O 
high O 
price O 
of O 
20,000 O 
US O 
dollars O 
per O 
minute O 
. O 

While O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
military O 
searched O 
everywhere O 
for O 
information O 
on O 
bin B-PER 
Laden I-PER 
in O 
vain O 
, O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
frequently O 
aired O 
the O 
footage O 
of O 
bin B-PER 
Laden I-PER 
making O 
a O 
speech O 
. O 

Mr. O 
Wu B-PER 
, O 
we O 
know O 
that O 
you O 
happened O 
to O 
be O 
in O 
Qatar B-LOC 
when O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
was O 
just O 
established O 
in O 
1996 O 
. O 

What O 
did O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
look O 
like O 
when O 
it O 
just O 
started O 
broadcasting O 
? O 

We O 
reporters O 
in O 
Qatar B-LOC 
were O 
also O 
invited O 
to O 
attend O 
this O 
inaugural O 
broadcast O 
ceremony O 
. O 

But O 
at O 
the O 
time O 
of O 
its O 
establishment O 
, O 
this O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
already O 
had O 
a O 
very O 
good O 
foundation O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
reporters O 
. O 

In O 
1995 O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
the O 
British O 
BBC B-ORG 
's O 
Arabic B-ORG 
Language I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
Station I-ORG 
was O 
shut O 
down O 
due O 
to O 
funding O 
problems O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
seized O 
this O 
opportunity O 
to O 
get O 
hold O 
of O 
, O 
this O 
entire O 
group O 
of O 
people O 
by O 
hiring O 
them O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
as O 
their O 
reporters O 
, O 
editors O 
, O 
or O 
anchors O 
at O 
high O 
salaries O 
. O 

In O 
this O 
respect O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
let O 
me O 
add O 
one O 
point O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
this O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
its O 
style O 
is O 
very O 
much O 
characterized O 
by O 
direct O 
borrowing O 
from O 
the O 
West B-LOC 
, O 
for O 
instance O 
, O 
the O 
two O 
mainstream O 
media O 
outlets O 
. O 

One O 
is O 
CNN B-ORG 
, O 
and O 
the O 
other O 
is O 
BBC B-ORG 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
I O 
think O 
that O 
BBC B-ORG 
, O 
in O 
particular O 
, O 
has O 
quite O 
a O 
big O 
influence O 
on O 
it O 
. O 

Just O 
now O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
many O 
of O 
its O 
reporters O 
directly O 
came O 
from O 
the O 
Middle B-LOC 
East I-LOC 
channel O 
at O 
that O 
time O 
. O 

That O 
was O 
jointly O 
run O 
by O 
BBC B-ORG 
and O 
Saudi B-LOC 
Arabia I-LOC 
. O 

In O 
addition O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
actually O 
, O 
this O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
has O 
a O 
quite O 
unique O 
structure O 
. O 

He O 
studied O 
in O 
Britain B-LOC 
and O 
therefore O 
had O 
quite O 
a O 
good O 
knowledge O 
of O 
Britain B-LOC 
's O 
BBC B-ORG 
TV O 
station O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
in O 
this O 
way O 
, O 
it O 
has O 
borrowed O 
some O 
of O 
the O 
BBC B-ORG 
style O 
. O 

For O 
instance O 
, O 
Britain B-LOC 
's O 
BBC B-ORG 
is O 
a O 
very O 
old O 
TV O 
group O 
established O 
in O 
1927 O 
. O 

For O 
instance O 
, O 
the O 
top O 
decision O 
- O 
making O 
body O 
of O 
BBC B-ORG 
is O 
called O 
the O 
board O 
of O 
directors O 
which O 
are O 
composed O 
of O 
twelve O 
members O 
directly O 
appointed O 
by O 
the O 
Queen O 
. O 

So O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
has O 
also O 
adopted O 
this O 
structure O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
speaking O 
of O 
its O 
influence O 
, O 
we O 
have O 
also O 
noticed O 
that O 
er O 
, O 
during O 
the O 
Afghan O 
war O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
because O 
it O 
has O 
the O 
exclusive O 
interview O 
right O 
to O 
enter O 
Afghanistan B-LOC 
to O 
conduct O 
independent O 
and O 
exclusive O 
interviews O 
, O 
we O 
could O 
say O 
this O 
is O 
one O 
of O 
its O 
advantages O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
as O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
has O 
been O 
able O 
to O 
develop O 
into O 
its O 
current O 
status O 
, O 
what O 
do O 
you O 
think O 
has O 
it O 
relied O 
upon O 
so O 
that O 
its O 
competitiveness O 
and O 
influential O 
power O 
, O 
even O 
surpassed O 
CNN B-ORG 
and O 
BBC B-ORG 
during O 
the O 
Iraq O 
war O 
? O 

The O 
greatest O 
feature O 
of O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
is O 
that O 
it O 
is O 
a O 
small O 
station O 
that O 
competes O 
with O 
large O 
ones O 
and O 
has O 
become O 
well O 
- O 
known O 
through O 
wars O 
. O 

Besides O 
, O 
it O 
has O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
resources O 
, O 
including O 
its O 
exclusive O 
coverage O 
right O 
in O 
Afghanistan B-LOC 
as O 
you O 
mentioned O 
just O 
now O 
. O 

In O 
addition O 
, O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
is O 
actually O 
quite O 
unique O 
in O 
the O 
Arab O 
region O 
. O 

For O 
instance O 
, O 
a O 
very O 
tough O 
conflict O 
in O 
this O 
region O 
is O 
the O 
conflict O 
between O 
Palestine O 
and O 
Israel B-LOC 
. O 

However O 
, O 
for O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
, O 
it O 
could O 
invite O 
Barak B-PER 
, O 
the O 
Israeli O 
prime O 
minister O 
at O 
that O 
time O 
, O 
to O 
deliver O 
a O 
speech O 
at O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

I O 
think O 
that O 
favorable O 
opportunities O 
and O 
geographical O 
conditions O 
also O 
helped O 
because O 
people O 
involved O 
in O 
the O 
Afghan O 
war O 
and O 
the O 
Taliban B-ORG 
were O 
mostly O 
Arabs O 
. O 

In O 
particular O 
, O 
it O 
was O 
the O 
same O 
with O 
the O 
, O 
Iraq O 
war O 
, O 
which O 
took O 
place O 
in O 
Iraq B-LOC 
. O 

In O 
the O 
, O 
Iraq O 
war O 
, O 
as O 
far O 
as O 
I O 
know O 
, O 
among O 
foreign O 
media O 
teams O 
dispatched O 
to O 
Iraq B-LOC 
for O 
coverage O 
, O 
I O 
should O 
say O 
, O 
the O 
one O 
from O 
Qatar B-LOC

was O 
the O 
most O 
powerful O 
. O 

It O 
had O 
three O 
reporting O 
stations O 
at O 
that O 
time O 
, O 
one O 
group O 
in O 
the O 
south O 
in O 
Basra B-LOC 
, O 
well O 
, O 
one O 
group O 
in O 
Baghdad B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
still O 
another O 
group O 
in O 
the O 
north O 
in O 
Mosul B-LOC 
. O 

So O 
it O 
was O 
basically O 
covering O 
the O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
Iraq B-LOC 
war O 
from O 
all O 
perspectives O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
as O 
it O 
is O 
becoming O 
more O 
and O 
more O 
influential O 
and O 
competitive O 
, O 
it O 
has O 
also O 
become O 
a O 
thorn O 
in O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
side O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
today O 
we O 
should O 
say O 
we O 
have O 
just O 
given O 
an O 
introduction O 
of O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

What O 
conflicts O 
are O 
there O 
between O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
and O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
? O 

Why O 
has O 
it O 
become O 
a O 
thorn O 
in O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
side O 
? O 

Since O 
it O 
gained O 
instant O 
fame O 
during O 
the O 
Afghan O 
war O 
, O 
the O 
style O 
of O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
in O 
pursuit O 
of O 
the O 
freedom O 
of O 
the O 
press O 
and O 
independence O 
has O 
gradually O 
won O 
widespread O 
international O 
attention O 
. O 

However O 
, O 
at O 
the O 
same O 
time O 
, O 
the O 
conflict O 
between O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
and O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
has O 
been O 
increasing O 
. O 

According O 
to O 
reports O 
, O 
Bush B-PER 
, O 
Rumsfeld B-PER 
, O 
and O 
Powell B-PER 
repeatedly O 
expressed O 
their O 
strong O 
displeasure O 
with O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
directly O 
to O 
the O 
Qatari O 
leaders O 
, O 
demanding O 
its O 
government O 
to O 
restrain O 
it O 
more O 
firmly O 
. O 

The O 
US B-LOC 
government O 
thinks O 
that O 
radicals O 
, O 
anti-American O 
and O 
religious O 
commentators O 
have O 
become O 
frequent O 
guests O 
at O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

All O 
these O 
made O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
hate O 
and O 
fear O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
at O 
the O 
same O 
time O 
. O 

During O 
the O 
Iraq O 
war O 
, O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
not O 
only O 
broadcast O 
Bush B-PER 
's O 
and O 
Blair B-PER 
's O 
impassioned O 
pre-war O 
speeches O 
and O 
the O 
image O 
of O 
coalition O 
troops O 
marching O 
toward O 
Iraq B-LOC 
, O 
but O 
also O 
broadcast O 
the O 
bloody O 
bodies O 
of O 
civilians O 
next O 
to O 
bombed O 
cars O 
. O 

If O 
you O 
see O 
the O 
war O 
on O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
TV O 
as O 
an O 
electronic O 
game O 
and O 
grand O 
display O 
of O 
smoke O 
and O 
fire O 
, O 
then O 
from O 
the O 
footage O 
by O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
, O 
you O 
see O 
the O 
war O 
only O 
as O 
hell O 
. O 

Do O 
you O 
still O 
remember O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
during O 
the O 
Afghan O 
war O 
and O 
the O 
Iraq O 
war O 
, O 
we O 
could O 
often O 
see O 
on O 
screen O 
the O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
footage O 
such O 
as O 
bin B-PER 
Laden I-PER 
and O 
some O 
other O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Qaeda I-ORG 
leaders O 
giving O 
speeches O 
. O 

Ah O 
, O 
moreover O 
, O 
the O 
footage O 
that O 
many O 
other O 
TV O 
stations O 
were O 
using O 
also O 
basically O 
came O 
from O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

Therefore O 
, O 
at O 
that O 
time O 
Americans O 
, O 
said O 
that O 
since O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
broadcast O 
these O 
activities O 
of O 
terrorists O 
, O 
it O 
must O 
be O 
colluding O 
with O 
terrorists O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
it O 
was O 
always O 
thought O 
that O 
there O 
seemed O 
to O 
be O 
some O 
subtle O 
relationship O 
between O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
and O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Qaeda I-ORG 
. O 

Since O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
the O 
Taliban B-ORG 
people O 
were O 
all O 
Arabs O 
, O 
they O 
tried O 
by O 
various O 
means O 
to O 
gain O 
the O 
information O 
so O 
as O 
to O 
expand O 
their O 
own O 
influence O 
. O 

This O 
has O 
been O 
the O 
consistent O 
practice O 
of O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

In O 
other O 
words O 
, O 
it O 
also O 
benefits O 
from O 
the O 
hard O 
work O 
of O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
when O 
it O 
makes O 
a O 
report O 
, O 
its O 
perspective O 
, O 
analysis O 
, O 
and O 
its O 
possible O 
outcome O 
or O 
some O 
process O 
of O 
its O 
analysis O 
are O 
different O 
from O 
those O 
of O 
reports O 
by O 
the O 
Western O 
mainstream O 
media O 
such O 
as O 
CNN B-ORG 
and O 
BBC B-ORG 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
exactly O 
because O 
of O 
this O 
, O 
even O 
if O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
may O 
not O 
be O 
necessarily O 
linked O 
with O 
any O 
other O 
organizations O 
, O 
simply O 
because O 
it O 
reports O 
the O 
war O 
using O 
a O 
different O 
voice O 
, O 
it O 
has O 
become O 
the O 
target O 
of O 
attacks O 
by O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
or O 
the O 
West B-LOC 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
regarding O 
this O 
incident O 
, O 
what O 
kind O 
of O 
reaction O 
did O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
have O 
? O 

But O 
when O 
our O 
correspondents O 
went O 
to O 
have O 
an O 
interview O 
at O 
the O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
's O 
Beijing B-LOC 
office O 
today O 
, O 
they O 
asked O 
their O 
office O 
administrator O 
named O 
Ezzat B-PER 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
the O 
question O 
why O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
threatened O 
to O 
bomb O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
? O 

So O 
, O 
it O 
wanted O 
to O 
blame O 
its O 
mistakes O 
in O 
this O 
region O 
on O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

So O 
, O 
the O 
issue O 
is O 
not O 
that O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
is O 
making O 
anti-American O 
reports O 
. O 

Then O 
, O 
in O 
the O 
end O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
Secretary O 
Rumsfeld B-PER 
also O 
directly O 
blamed O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

That O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
this O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
, O 
due O 
to O 
its O 
unique O 
perspective O 
, O 
is O 
different O 
from O 
what O 
is O 
expected O 
of O 
it O 
. O 

At O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
, O 
there O 
is O 
, O 
one O 
famous O 
saying O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
if O 
the O 
whole O 
world O 
listens O 
to O 
CNN B-ORG 
, O 
or O 
the O 
whole O 
world O 
watches O 
CNN B-ORG 
, O 
then O 
whom O 
does O 
CNN B-ORG 
watch O 
or O 
listen O 
to O 
? O 

Well O 
, O 
in O 
fact O 
, O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
has O 
long O 
been O 
suppressing O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
. O 

For O 
instance O 
, O 
the O 
al B-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
's O 
office O 
in O 
Afghanistan B-LOC 
was O 
bombed O 
in O 
2001 O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
in O 
2003 O 
, O 
the O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
's O 
office O 
in O 
Baghdad B-LOC 
was O 
also O 
bombed O 
. O 

Eh O 
, O 
it O 
was O 
said O 
that O 
a O 
Sudanese O 
correspondent O 
from O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
was O 
arrested O 
in O 
Afghanistan B-LOC 
and O 
has O 
been O 
detained O 
ever O 
since O 
at O 
this O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
US B-LOC 
military O 
base O 
at O 
Guantanamo B-LOC 
. O 

We O 
could O 
say O 
that O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
has O 
been O 
suppressing O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
for O 
quite O 
a O 
long O 
time O 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
will O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
really O 
sue O 
US B-LOC 
President O 
Bush B-PER 
? O 

Well O 
, O 
now O 
we O 
have O 
seen O 
that O 
the O 
director O 
of O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
has O 
also O 
flown O 
to O 
London B-LOC 
to O 
demand O 
an O 
explanation O 
from O 
Blair B-PER 
. O 

The O 
main O 
idea O 
of O 
the O 
statement O 
was O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
that O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
TV I-ORG 
station O 
has O 
always O 
followed O 
the O 
principle O 
of O 
impartiality O 
, O 
neutrality O 
, O 
and O 
balance O 
in O 
news O 
coverage O 
. O 

For O 
that O 
purpose O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
now O 
seriously O 
investigating O 
the O 
news O 
about O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
plan O 
to O 
bomb O 
the O 
al B-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Jazeera I-ORG 
headquarters O 
in O 
reported O 
by O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
the O 
British O 
newspaper O 
, O 
and O 
it O 
hopes O 
that O 
the O 
British O 
government O 
can O 
explain O 
this O 
. O 

All O 
right O 
, O 
dear O 
viewers O 
, O 
that O 
's O 
all O 
for O 
today O 
's O 
edition O 
of O 
Focus B-ORG 
Today I-ORG 
. O 

Besides O 
not O 
having O 
to O 
pay O 
tuition O 
, O 
at O 
that O 
time O 
, O 
for O 
example O 
, O 
at O 
our O 
Agriculture B-ORG 
University I-ORG 
, O 
all O 
students O 
had O 
very O 
substantial O 
student O 
grants O 
. O 

Therefore O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
the O 
study O 
by O 
the B-ORG 
Ministry I-ORG 
of I-ORG 
Public I-ORG 
Security I-ORG 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
discussed O 
and O 
put O 
forth O 
several O 
hard O 
- O 
line O 
measures O 
. O 

Besides O 
these O 
eight O 
measures O 
by O 
the B-ORG 
Ministry I-ORG 
of I-ORG 
Public I-ORG 
Security I-ORG 
, O 
the B-ORG 
Ministry I-ORG 
of I-ORG 
Education I-ORG 
also O 
has O 
six O 
measures O 
. O 

The B-ORG 
Ministry I-ORG 
of I-ORG 
Health I-ORG 
asked O 
that O 
health O 
care O 
organizations O 
focus O 
on O 
the O 
patient O 
. O 

After O 
that O 
, O 
they O 
achieved O 
a O 
result O 
where O 
in O 
the O 
Han O 
Kuang O 
21 O 
exercises O 
they O 
were O 
able O 
to O 
have O 
a O 
Kidd B-PER 
- O 
class O 
battleship O 
fleet O 
intercept O 
a O 
so O 
- O 
called O 
mainland O 
landing O 
force O 
, O 
intercept O 
a O 
PLA B-ORG 
force O 
of O 
forty O 
thousand O 
. O 

Next O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
let O 
's O 
direct O 
our O 
attention O 
to O 
the O 
change O 
from O 
the B-ORG 
Self I-ORG 
Defense I-ORG 
Forces I-ORG 
to O 
the B-ORG 
Self I-ORG 
- I-ORG 
Defense I-ORG 
Military I-ORG 
. O 

Well O 
, O 
if O 
the B-ORG 
Self I-ORG 
Defense I-ORG 
Forces I-ORG 
become O 
the B-ORG 
Self I-ORG 
Defense I-ORG 
Military I-ORG 
, O 
what O 
changes O 
will O 
it O 
bring O 
to O 
Japan B-LOC 
's O 
military O 
itself O 
. O 

So O 
it O 
is O 
called O 
the O 
SDF B-ORG 
. O 

So O 
the B-ORG 
Defense I-ORG 
Agency I-ORG 
should O 
be O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
first O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
upgraded O 
to O 
a O 
ministry O 
. O 

So O 
in O 
the O 
process O 
of O 
this O 
upgrade O 
to O 
a O 
ministry O 
, O 
it O 
has O 
started O 
adjusting O 
the O 
duties O 
of O 
the O 
SDF B-ORG 
. O 

We O 
know O 
this O 
time O 
this O 
Defense O 
Ministry O 
bill O 
has O 
already O 
incorporated O 
the O 
original O 
supplementary O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
duties O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
of O 
the O 
SDF B-ORG 
into O 
its O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
primary O 
duties O 
. O 

The O 
so O 
- O 
called O 
supplementary O 
duties O 
, O 
we O 
know O 
, O 
include O 
the O 
participation O 
in O 
UN B-ORG 
peacekeeping O 
operations O 
, O 
this O 
, O 
international O 
rescue O 
missions O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
and O 
logistic O 
support O 
for O 
the O 
US O 
military O 
in O 
accordance O 
with O 
its O 
so O 
- O 
called O 
Law O 
Concerning O 
Situation O 
in O 
Areas O 
Surrounding O 
Japan O 
. O 

Now O 
with O 
the O 
upgrading O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Defense I-ORG 
Agency I-ORG 
to O 
a O 
ministry O 
, O 
they O 
will O 
all O 
be O 
incorporated O 
into O 
the O 
primary O 
operations O 
of O 
the O 
SDF B-ORG 
. O 

To O 
put O 
it O 
in O 
more O 
common O 
terms O 
, O 
it O 
means O 
that O 
the O 
SDF B-ORG 
mainly O 
took O 
care O 
of O 
affairs O 
at O 
home O 
in O 
the O 
past O 
, O 
and O 
in O 
the O 
future O 
the O 
SDF B-ORG 
will O 
be O 
mainly O 
engaged O 
in O 
external O 
affairs O 
. O 

He O 
ordered O 
the O 
disbanding O 
of O 
the O 
Iraq B-LOC 
military O 
and O 
ordered O 
that O 
the B-ORG 
Baath I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
be O 
declared O 
illegal O 
. O 

But O 
on O 
the O 
other O 
hand O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
in O 
the O 
five O 
years O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
following O 
our O 
accession O 
to O 
the O 
WTO B-ORG 
, O 
we O 
have O 
been O 
dancing O 
with O 
wolves O 
. O 

For O 
example O 
, O 
Haier B-ORG 
, O 
when O 
companies O 
like O 
Haier B-ORG 
, O 
Lenovo B-ORG 
, O 
and O 
Huawei B-ORG 
go O 
abroad O 
, O 
in O 
fact O 
others O 
also O 
see O 
it O 
as O 
an O 
arrival O 
of O 
Chinese O 
wolves O 
, O 
who O 
are O 
seen O 
as O 
immature O 
yet O 
equally O 
capable O 
of O 
biting O 
people O 
. O 

At O 
the O 
same O 
time O 
, O 
it O 
supports O 
the O 
tentative O 
idea O 
proposed O 
by O 
China B-LOC 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
to O 
set O 
up O 
within O 
the B-ORG 
Six I-ORG 
Party I-ORG 
Talks I-ORG 
several O 
special O

One O 
of O 
my O 
greatest O 
impressions O 
of O 
such O 
major O

as O 
the O 
Paris O

-- O 
later O 
I O 
read O 
a B-ORG 
People I-ORG

Daily I-ORG 
editorial O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
written O 
by O 
a O 
reporter O 
-- O 
there O 
were O 
no O 
auto O 
showgirls O 
. O 

Then O 
, O 
during O 
last O 
exhibition O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
in O 
2004 O 
, O 
among O 
several O 
international O 
participants O 
, O 
only O 
Ford B-ORG

rated O 
the O 
Beijing O

show O 
in O 
the O 
grade O 
- O 
A O 
category O 
. O 

Because O 
we O 
also O 
know O 
that O 
actually O 
the O 
engines O 
in O 
some O 
models O 
of O 
Chery B-ORG 
are O 
not O 
made O 
by O 
the O 
company O 
itself O 
, O 
so O 
how O 
do O 
we O 
explain O 
domestic O 
brand O

In O 
addition O 
, O 
we O 
also O 
heard O 
some O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
rumors O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
to O 
say O 
, O 
er O 
, O 
that O 
now O 
Chery B-ORG 
is O 
also O 
talking O 
with O 
other O 
brand O 
makers O 
on O 
joint O 
venture O 
or O 
collaboration O 
. O 

It O 
will O 
use O 
the O 
other O 
party O

market O 
and O 
produce O 
the O 
Chery B-ORG 
brand O

Producing O 
the O 
Chery B-ORG 
brand O 
and O 
products O 
. O 

It O 
's O 
like O 
this O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
Supreme I-ORG 
People I-ORG 
's I-ORG 
Court I-ORG 
the O 
year O 
before O 
last O 
approved O 
another O 
interpretation O 
of O 
the O

: O 
for O 
all O 
illegal O 
production O 
, O 
buying O 
or O 
selling O 
of O 
the O

of O 
high O 
- O 
level O 
official O 
departments O 
at O 
the O 
army O 
headquarters O 
level O 
or O 
higher O 
, O 
the O 
transaction O 
of O 
one O 
plate O 
is O 
enough O 
to O 
constitute O 
criminal O 
activity O 
. O 

Yes O 
, O 
if O 
observing O 
from O 
the O 
overall O 
statistics O 
, O 
and O 
in O 
fact O 
the O 
CCP B-ORG 
itself O 
has O 
also O 
announced O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
that O 
the O 
CCP B-ORG 
's O 
economy O 
will O 
face O 
a O 
crisis O 
of O 
collapse O 
in O 
2008 O 
. O 

Right O 
, O 
the O 
lawyers O 
had O 
said O 
a O 
little O 
earlier O 
that O 
if O 
they O 
maintain O 
the O 
original O 
judgment O 
in O 
Chen B-PER 
Guangcheng I-PER 
's I-PER 
case O 
, O 
they O 
would O 
immediately O 
appeal O 
to O 
the B-ORG 
Linyi I-ORG 
Municipal I-ORG 
Intermediate I-ORG 
People I-ORG 
's I-ORG 
Court I-ORG 
. O 

I O 
will O 
prepare O 
to O 
test O 
into O 
Harvard B-ORG 
. O 

If O 
Harvard B-ORG 
does O 
n't O 
come O 
through O 
, O 
I O 
'll O 
take O 
the O 
test O 
to O 
get O 
into O 
Yale B-ORG 
. O 

We O 
know O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
that O 
originally O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
this O 
entire O 
world O 
trade O 
system O 
was O 
called O 
a O 
multilateral O 
trade O 
framework O 
based O 
on O 
the O 
WTO B-ORG 
. O 

The O 
precursor O 
to O 
the O 
WTO B-ORG 
was O 
GATT B-ORG 
. O 

Er O 
, O 
it O 
is O 
forming O 
what O 
is O 
called O 
Ten B-ORG 
plus I-ORG 
One I-ORG 
with O 
itself O 
as O 
the O 
center O 
. O 

A B-ORG 
Ten I-ORG 
plus I-ORG 
One I-ORG 
with O 
China B-LOC 
. O 

Then O 
, O 
it O 
has O 
five O 
Ten B-ORG 
plus I-ORG 
One's I-ORG 
with O 
such O 
developed O 
countries O 
as O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
and O 
Japan B-LOC 
, O 
and O 
with O 
South B-LOC 
Korea I-LOC 
. O 

Its O 
negotiations O 
are O 
underway O 
, O 
but O 
the O 
one O 
finally O 
negotiated O 
successfully O 
was O 
the B-ORG 
Ten I-ORG 
plus I-ORG 
One I-ORG 
with O 
China B-LOC 
. O 

This O 
trend O 
is O 
in O 
fact O 
that O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
while O 
pushing O 
for O 
the O 
multilateral O 
trade O 
agreement O 
based O 
on O 
the O 
WTO B-ORG 
, O 
everyone O 
is O 
additionally O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
forming O 
a O 
-- O 
we O 
may O 
not O 
count O 
on O 
that O 
thing O 
, O 
we O 
do O 
our O 
own O 
things O 
first O 
, O 

So O 
, O 
like O 
the O 
APEC O 
meeting O 
in O 
Vietnam O 
this O 
time O 
, O 
in O 
fact O 
the O 
US B-LOC 
proposed O 
that O 
since O 
that O 
Doha O 
Round O 
talks O 
may O 
be O 
delayed O 
indefinitely O 
, O 
our O 
China B-LOC 
can O 
now O 
traverse O 
across O 
the B-LOC 
, I-LOC 
this I-LOC 
, I-LOC 
Pacific I-LOC 
Ocean I-LOC 
via O 
APEC B-ORG 
to O 
form O 
a O 
free O 
trade O 
zone O 
first O 
. O 

So O 
he O 
especially O 
handed O 
over O 
to O 
me O 
the O 
role O 
of O 
representing O 
him O 
in O 
future O 
affairs O 
between O 
the O 
two O

and O 
to O 
represent O 
him O 
in O 
carrying O 
out O 
direct O 
communication O 
with O 
Chairman O 
Ma B-PER 
. O 

So O 
in O 
this O 
situation O 
, O 
he O 
was O 
also O 
particularly O 
hoping O 
that O 
I O 
could O 
pass O 
on O 
the O

two O

uh O

a O 
bunch O 
of O 
us O 
in O

worry O 
that O 
the O

that O 
we O 
have O 
today O

not O 
big O 
enough O

we O

Um O 
maybe O 
I O 
believe O 
we O

actually O 
need O 
uh O 
uh O 
an O 
increase O

the O

it O

All O 
right O 
I O 
asked O 
the O 
New B-ORG

editor O 
Bill B-PER 
Keller I-PER 
ah O 
this O 
past O

about O

acting O 
above O 
the O

There O 
were O 
so O 
many O

about O

high O

people O 
in O

did O 
you O 
feel O

the B-ORG 
National I-ORG

for O 
the O 
first O

analyzed O 
the O 
reasons O 
for O 
the O 
failure O

report O 
the O 
Tangshan B-LOC

. O 

The B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Seismology I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
believes O 
, O 
first O 
, O 
that O 
it O 
did O 
not O 
clearly O 
recognize O 
the O 
relationship O 
between O 
anomalies O 
and O 
earthquakes O 
, O 
and O 
it O 
made O 
errors O 
in O 
assessing O 
the O 
earthquake O

On O 
the O 
eve O 
of O 
the O 
twentieth O 
anniversary O 
of O 
the O 
Great O 
Tangshan O 
Earthquake O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
in O 
April O 
of O 
1996 O 
, O 
Qinglong B-LOC 
was O 
chosen O 
by O 
a O 
United B-ORG

agency O 
to O 
become O 
a O 
successful O 
model O 
for O 
the O 
integration O 
of O

research O 
and O 
administrative O 
management O 
. O 

In O 
fact O 
, O 
on O 
August O 
20 O 
, O 
1976 O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
Hebei I-ORG 
Science I-ORG

had O 
issued O 
a O 
brief O

which O 
for O 
the O 
first O 
time O 
revealed O 
the O 
facts O 
about O 
Qinglong B-LOC 
having O 
successfully O 
prepared O 
against O 
the O 
Great O 
Tangshan O 
Earthquake O 
. O 

Right O 
up O 
until O 
1995 O 
, O 
when O 
the B-ORG

' I-ORG 
Dr. O

came O 
to O 
Beijing B-LOC 
to O

about O 
Qinglong B-LOC 
for O 
the O 
first O

The O 
following O 
year O 
, O 
after O 
receiving O 
permission O 
from O 
the O 
Chinese O 
government O 
, O 
this O 
female O 
UN B-ORG

headed O 
up O 
a O

in O

and O 
conducted O 
an O 
on O

site O 
investigation O 
in O 
Qinglong B-LOC

At O 
the O 
time O 
Wang B-PER

for O 
the B-ORG 
Qinglong I-ORG

and O 
it O 
was O 
he O 
who O 
first O 
brought O 
news O 
of O 
the O 
great O 
earthquake O 
back O 
to O 
Qinglong B-LOC 
. O 

The O 
local O

the O 
person O 
responsible O 
for O 
running O 
the B-ORG 
Qinglong I-ORG 
County I-ORG

was O 
named O 
Wang B-PER 
Chunqing I-PER

Opening O 
this O 
conference O 
, O 
at O 
the O 
time O 
, O 
Wang B-PER 
Chengmin I-PER 
of O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Seismology I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
came O 
. O 

He O 
received O 
these O 
opinions O 
and O 
also O 
heard O 
that O 
Tangshan B-ORG 
Second I-ORG 
Middle I-ORG 
School I-ORG 
said O 
so O 
, O 

uh O 
, O 
teacher O 
Tian B-PER 
Jinwu I-PER 
of O 
Tangshan B-ORG 
Second I-ORG 
Middle I-ORG 
School I-ORG 
also O 
said O 
like O 
that O 
, O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
earthquake O 
prediction O 
is O 
part O 
of O 
the O 
three O 
essential O 
earthquake O 
requisites O 
, O 
right O 
? O 

On O 
November O 
8 O 
, O 
1976 O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Seismology I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
released O 
its O 
seventeenth O 
seismic O 
report O 
. O 

The B-ORG 
Kailuan I-ORG 
Mine I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
was O 
another O 
miracle O 
. O 

The O 
miracle O 
was O 
that O 
10,000 O 
miners O 
working O 
in O 
Kailuan B-ORG 
Mine I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
mines O 
successfully O 
escaped O 
danger O 
in O 
the O 
Great O 
Tangshan O 
Earthquake O 
, O 
and O 
this O 
established O 
a O 
model O 
for O 
disaster O 
prevention O 
and O 
preparation O 
. O 

Before O 
the O 
Great O 
Tangshan O 
Earthquake O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
Kailuan I-ORG 
Mine I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
did O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
work O 
to O 
establish O 
feasible O 
measures O 
to O 
ensure O 
that O 
underground O 
miners O 
safely O 
escape O 
dangers O 
. O 

The B-ORG 
Kailuan I-ORG 
Mine I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
set O 
up O 
an O 
earthquake O 
preparedness O 
leadership O 
group O 
, O 
organized O 
at O 
various O 
levels O 
, O 
right O 
. O 

The B-ORG 
Kailuan I-ORG 
Mine I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
, O 
following O 
the O 
principle O 
that O 
it O 
is O 
better O 
to O 
have O 
a O 
thousand O 
days O 
without O 
an O 
earthquake O 
than O 
one O 
day O 
of O 
unpreparedness O 
, O 
and O 
based O 
on O 
the O 
idea O 
that O 
there O 
will O 
be O 
an O 
earthquake O 
, O 
a O 
large O 
earthquake O 
, O 
and O 
soon O 
, O 
constantly O 
focused O 
on O 
underground O 
earthquake O 
- O 
proofing O 
work O 
. O 

So O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
Kailuan I-ORG 
Mine I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
, O 
they O 
certainly O 
did O 
n't O 
pin O 
all O 
their O 
hopes O 
on O 
someone O 
issuing O 
an O 
earthquake O 
forecast O 
. O 

Their O 
focus O 
on O 
earthquake O 
forecasting O 
was O 
, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
whenever O 
the O 
earthquake O 
hits O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
Kailuan I-ORG 
Mine I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
says O 
we O 
have O 
to O 
assure O 
the O 
miners O 
underground O 
. O 

When O 
the O 
Great O 
Tangshan O 
Earthquake O 
hit O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
Kailuan I-ORG 
Mine I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
was O 
situated O 
in O 
the O 
extreme O 
quake O 
zone O 
. O 

Finally O 
, O 
the O 
CCP B-ORG 
members O 
came O 
up O 
last O 
, O 
and O 
at O 
the O 
time O 
Jia B-PER 
Bangyou I-PER 
said O 
, O 
CCP B-ORG 
members O 
come O 
up O 
last O 
. O 

I O 
really O 
admire O 
this O 
group O 
of O 
CCP B-ORG 
members O 
who O 
were O 
at O 
the B-LOC 
Lu I-LOC 
jiatuo I-LOC 
Mine I-LOC 
in O 
1976 O 
. O 

The O 
CCP B-ORG 
members O 
who O 
were O 
at O 
the B-LOC 
Lu I-LOC 
jiatuo I-LOC 
Mine I-LOC 
in O 
1976 O 
were O 
the O 
last O 
to O 
come O 
up O 
. O 

The B-ORG 
Kailuan I-ORG 
Mine I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
has O 
lost O 
only O 
seven O 
out O 
of O 
10,000 O 
of O 
its O 
mine O 
workers O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
a O 
miracle O 
of O 
disaster O 
preparedness O 
. O 

, O 
I O 
mean O 
, O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG 
Seismology I-ORG 
Bureau I-ORG 
should O 
have O 
predicted O 
this O 
earthquake O 
coming O 
. O 

Rather O 
, O 
it O 
's O 
in O 
, O 
the O 
attitudes O 
of O 
some O 
of O 
the O 
officials O 
of O 
the B-ORG 
National I-ORG

I O

That O 
included O 
at O 
the O 
time O 
, O 
, O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
politics O 
, O 
certainly O 
some O 
campaigns O 
like O 
the B-ORG

, O 
had O 
an O 
effect O

the O 
Real O

87 O 
for O 
the O

was O 
under O 
discussion O 
by O 
members O 
of O 
Parliament B-ORG 
. O 

However O 
, O 
at O 
the O 
beginning O 
of O 
2004 O 
, O 
following O 
the O 
military O 
operations O 
, O 
it O 
was O 
a O 
period O 
of O 
occupation O 
, O 
and O 
the B-ORG 
Ruling I-ORG 
Council I-ORG 
deemed O 
it O 
appropriate O 
to O 
extend O 
it O 
for O 
two O 
more O 
years O 
, O 
which O 
ended O 
this O 
year O 
, O 
in O 
2006 O 
. O 

Today O 
, O 
the O 
Assembly B-ORG 
is O 
discussing O 
this O 
issue O 
and O 
wants O 
to O 
extend O 
it O 
another O 
year O 
or O 
two O 
, O 
since O 
the O 
abnormal O 
conditions O 
today O 
in O

are O 
not O 
appropriate O

impose O 
rates O

they O 
are O 
at O 
the O

particularly O 
with O 
respect O 
to O 
the O

Uh O 
, O

consequently O 
, O 
there O 
was O

fiery O

So O 
you O
